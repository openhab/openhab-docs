# The ZWave Database

HABmin is using an internal database to fetch configuration data corresponding to the device.


If this device is not in the database, then no device name nor model will be displayed but a code identifying the device.

![](../Adding_a_new_thing/images/zwave-node-badnode.png)

In this example, the Thing "Z-wave Node 3" has not been found in the ZWave database and the Thing "Z-wave Node 4" has been successfully identified.
