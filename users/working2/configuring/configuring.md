This panel contains the following information:
* The label giving you the model name of the *Thing*, read-only,
* The overview, giving a description of the *Thing*, coming from the ZWave database, read-only,
* A set of controls, one per actionable *item* that has been created. You can play with the control in order to check that your device is correctly working. The name and the identifier of the *item* are read-only.

The name of the item can be modified in the channels panel.

Five buttons allow different actions:

HABmin 2 creates and link automatically the needed *items* when a *thing* is created, so creating, deleting and linking action are not often used.

To personalise item information, the *edit linked data* button opens the following window:
