# Overview

## What is openHAB ?

openHAB is a software for integrating different home automation systems and technologies into one single solution that allows over-arching automation rules and that offers uniform user interfaces.

openHAB 2 is the successor of [openHAB 1](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki). It is an open-source solution based on the [Eclipse SmartHome]() framework.

openHAB is a highly modular software, which means that the base installation (the "runtime") can be extended through different kinds of "add-ons".
