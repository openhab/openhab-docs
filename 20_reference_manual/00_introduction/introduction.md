# The documentation

The _reference manual_ has been built in order to be a handbook, companion of the user's manual.

The _Reference manual_ is an extensive reference of what is presented in the user’s manual. This manual is useful for you when you need to know all the details of something you have learnt in the User’s manual.

This manual is an on-going work.
