# Contribution Guidelines

## Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to
process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull
request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

## Conventions

Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch.

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a
reference to all the issues that they address.

Pull requests must not contain commits from other users or branches.

Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50
chars) written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed
explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the
suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Be
sure to post a comment after pushing. The new commits will show up in the pull
request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you
comment.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like `Closes #XXX`
or `Fixes #XXX`, which will automatically close the issue when merged.

## Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below (from
[developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```text
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line to every git commit message:

`Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>`

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.) and an
e-mail address under which you can be reached (sorry, no github noreply e-mail
addresses (such as username@users.noreply.github.com) or other non-reachable
addresses are allowed).

### Small patch exception

There are several exceptions to the signing requirement. Currently these are:

- Your patch fixes spelling or grammar errors.
- Your patch is a single line change to documentation.

## Community Guidelines

We want to keep the openHAB community awesome, growing and collaborative. We
need your help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some
general guidelines for the community as a whole:

- Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no
  regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people
  way better than mean ones!

- Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community
  feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their
  contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in
  our community.

- Keep it legal: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that
  you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the
  law.

- Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel
  and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or
  respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of
  people.  Please consider this before you update.  Also remember that
  nobody likes spam.
