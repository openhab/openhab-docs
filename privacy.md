### Cookies

Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain
any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.

Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically
deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete
them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the
site.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can
decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your
browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to

Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain
functions you wish to use are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of GDPR.
The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an
optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those
used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately

These data will not be combined with data from other sources. The basis for data
processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a

## Analytics and advertising

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc.,
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your
computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information
generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google
server in the USA and stored there.

Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has
a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.

### IP anonymization

We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened
by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic
Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address
sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf
of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website
activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the
website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not
be merged with any other data held by Google.

### Browser plugin

You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser.
However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full
functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use
of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these
data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

####  Objecting to the collection of data

You can also prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following
link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to
this site: <a href="javascript:gaOptout();">Disable Google Analytics</a>.

implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google
Analytics.

## Plugins and tools

### YouTube

Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is
YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. 

If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is
established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.

If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing
behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube
account.

YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant
to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of 
YouTube under [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy).

### Google Web Fonts

For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a
page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts
correctly.

For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus
becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is
done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a
justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer. Further
information about handling user data, can be found at
[https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq) and
in Google's privacy policy at
[https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

### Google Maps

This site uses the Google Maps map service via an API. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

To use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is generally
transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no
influence on this data transfer.

The use of Google Maps is in the interest of making our website appealing and to facilitate the
location of places specified by us on the website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant
to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of
Google at
[https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/).

### Twitter

Functions of the Twitter service have been integrated into our website and app. These features
are offered by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. When
you use Twitter and the “Retweet” function, the websites you visit are connected to your Twitter
account and made known to other users. In doing so, data will also be transferred to Twitter. We
would like to point out that, as the provider of these pages, we have no knowledge of the content
of the data transmitted or how it will be used by Twitter. For more information on Twitter's
privacy policy, please go to [https://twitter.com/privacy](https://twitter.com/privacy).

the option to revoke your consent at any time with future effect. It does not affect the
processing of data previously collected.
