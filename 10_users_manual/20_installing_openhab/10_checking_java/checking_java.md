# Checking Java

Before anything else, check that the correct version of Java has been installed.

To do this :

* Open the terminal window

* Type the following command `java -version`

* You should see something like this :

```
cal:~ callas$ java -version
java version "1.8.0 73"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)
```
