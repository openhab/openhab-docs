# Installing the designer

The Designer is an eclipse-based IDE allowing to edit text configuration file.

## Install

To do this:

* Go to the following site (it contains the latest version) : `https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/blob/master/docs/documentation/community/downloads.md#designer-builds.`
* In the nightly snapshots build, click on the link: `Eclipse SmartHome Designer (Mac OSX 64bit)`, to download it in your "download" folder.

* with the finder, navigate to the `openHAB` folder we created during the OpenHab installation
* create a new folder called `extra` in the `openHAB` folder
* move the file we have just downloaded inside this folder

## First launch of the designer

At the first launch only, we need to tell to the designer where are the configuration file.

To do so:

* using the finder, go to the `extra` folder we created just before;
* double-click on the `Eclipse SmartHome Designer` icon
* when the launch of the designer is completed, the following window appears:

At this stage, the configuration window is empty as the designer does not know where are the configuration files.

To tell it where are these files:

* click on the small `folder` icon at the top right of the configuration window,
* a file browser pops up,
* navigate to the `openHAB` folder we have created when installing openHAB,
* double-click on the `conf` folder,
