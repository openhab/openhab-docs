# Bundle Management

The [Karaf console](console.html) offers various commands to manage bundles. Most of these commands are not needed in the normal (non-developer) use of openHAB. However some basic commands are needed when dealing with some expert user situations like testing a binding.

## List Bundles

The _bundle:list_ command returns a list of all currently installed bundles including their version.

```text
openhab> bundle:list
START LEVEL 100 , List Threshold: 50
 ID | State    | Lvl | Version               | Name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 10 | Active   |  80 | 2.3.0.201506221200    | JAX-RS Gson Provider
 11 | Active   |  80 | 5.3.1.201602281253    | OSGi JAX-RS Connector
 12 | Active   |  80 | 2.3.1                 | Gson
 13 | Active   |  80 | 18.0.0                | Guava: Google Core Libraries for Java
 14 | Active   |  80 | 3.0.0.v201312141243   | Google Guice (No AOP)
...
209 | Active   |  80 | 2.0.0.b3              | Network Binding
```

## Start/Stop Bundles

Stoping a bundle is done with the command _stop_ and the ID of the bundle:

```text
openhab> bundle:stop 209
openhab> bundle:list
...
209 | Resolved |  80 | 2.0.0.b3              | Network Binding
```

The _start_ command works accordingly:

```text
openhab> bundle:start 209
openhab> bundle:list
...
209 | Active   |  80 | 2.0.0.b3              | Network Binding
```

## Naming Convention For Bundles

Bundles are named according to the following convention:

```text
<prefix>.<type>.<id>
```

where

- **prefix** is the first element to categorize the bundle.
  For addons this is `org.openhab`. 
- **type** is the add-on type, e.g. "binding" or "ui"
- **id** is the identifier for this bundle

The naming convention has many effects you may not have noticed before, but used already.
For example in the Paper UI the *sorted tabs* for all bindings are generated automatically based on the bundle naming.

In many places (e.g. logging) you will also have the **package namespace** as an identifier.
You can find it as the *Symbolic name* of the bundle with the following command:

```text
openhab> bundle:list -s
 ID | State    | Lvl | Version                | Name                        | Symbolic name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
209 | Active   |  80 | 2.1.0                  | Network Binding             | org.openhab.binding.network
```
