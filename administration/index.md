# Advanced Functionality and Administrative Tasks

As a runtime environment openHAB uses [Apache Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org), a modern and polymorphic container for hosting Java applications.
Karaf provides features such as a console CLI, remote access, hot deployment of modules, and dynamic configuration.
The Karaf Console is a powerful tool for interacting with and controlling your openHAB installation.
You will learn more about advanced administration of your openHAB installation, using the Karaf Console and other tools, in this section.
