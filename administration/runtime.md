# Runtime Commands

It is also possible to query and even change the state of entities like items or things. Therefore the console offers commands in various areas:

- [Commands](#commands)
- [Firmware](#firmware)
- [Inbox](#inbox)
- [Things](#things)
- [Items](#items)
- [Discovery](#discovery)

__Please note: Some of the commands described here are executed on the internal database and could brake your installation. So please use this functionality only if you know what you are doing!__


## Examples

Query an item's state:

```
openhab> smarthome:status Heating_GF_Corridor
OFF
```

Changing an item's state:

```
openhab> smarthome:send Heating_GF_Corridor ON
Command has been sent successfully.
```

Get help for a command:

```
openhab> help smarthome:send
Usage: smarthome:send <item> <command> - sends a command for an item
```
