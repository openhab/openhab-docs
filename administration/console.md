# Karaf Console

The Karaf console offers the option to:

* monitor the [log](logging.html#karaf-console) in realtime
* manage [bundles](bundles.html)
* [runtime commands](runtime.html)

# Accessing the Console

Accessing the Karaf console depends on the start mode of openHAB. The manually start using shell/batch script ends directly in the Karaf console.

If openHAB runs a service, the console can be accessed using ssh to the openHAB host on port 8101. The default Username/Password is **openhab/habopen**.

```
ssh karaf@localhost -p 8101
Password authentication
Password:

                          __  _____    ____      
  ____  ____  ___  ____  / / / /   |  / __ )     
 / __ \/ __ \/ _ \/ __ \/ /_/ / /| | / __  |
/ /_/ / /_/ /  __/ / / / __  / ___ |/ /_/ /      
\____/ .___/\___/_/ /_/_/ /_/_/  |_/_____/     
    /_/                        2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Hit '<tab>' for a list of available commands
and '[cmd] --help' for help on a specific command.
Hit '<ctrl-d>' or type 'system:shutdown' or 'logout' to shutdown openHAB.

openhab>
```

# Using the console

**Help** is listing all available commands:

```
openhab> help
```

or describes a specific subsystem/command:

```
openhab> help bundle
...

openhab> help bundle:stop
...
```

The console also supports auto-completion during input. Auto-Completion proposes possible commands based on the current input and is triggered by the **tab** key. So for example entering _bun_ and pressing the tab key will result in:

```  
openhab> bundle
bundle                   bundle:capabilities      bundle:classes           bundle:diag              bundle:dynamic-import    
bundle:find-class        bundle:headers           bundle:id                bundle:info              bundle:install           
bundle:list              bundle:load-test         bundle:refresh           bundle:requirements      bundle:resolve           
bundle:restart           bundle:services          bundle:start             bundle:start-level       bundle:stop              
bundle:tree-show         bundle:uninstall         bundle:update            bundle:watch      
```  

Another useful feature the **\| (pipe)** and **grep** functionality which filters long output lists:

```  
openhab> bundle:list | grep openHAB
164 | Active    |  90 | 2.0.0.201607210102    | openHAB Core
165 | Active    |  80 | 2.0.0.201607210102    | openHAB Karaf Integration
195 | Active    |  80 | 2.0.0.201607210102    | openHAB 1.x Compatibility Layer
196 | Active    |  80 | 2.0.0.201607210102    | openHAB REST Documentation
```

The Karaf session is ended by using the logout command:

```
openhab> logout
```

# Configuring the Console

By default due to security reasons openhab binds it's shell to localhost. If you are using local network or you are fully aware of all risks of exposing your system to public network you can change bind address in **org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg** config file. It can be found in the **runtime/karaf/etc/** folder (in case openHAB was installed via apt, the full path is: /usr/share/openhab2/runtime/karaf/etc/), replace line:

```
sshHost=127.0.0.1
```
to contain IP address you want to bind or 0.0.0.0 if you would like to bind to all available network interfaces:

```
sshHost=0.0.0.0
```

Please check the [Karaf reference](http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/) for details.
