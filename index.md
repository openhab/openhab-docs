# What is openHAB

openHAB is a software for integrating different home automation systems and technologies into one single solution that allows over-arching automation rules and that offers uniform user interfaces.

openHAB 2 is the successor of [openHAB 1](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki). It is an open-source solution based on the [Eclipse SmartHome]() framework.

openHAB is a highly modular software, which means that the base installation (the "runtime") can be extended through different kinds of "add-ons".

# User Documentation

The [_User Manual_](users/introduction/introduction.html) has been built in order to guide you for your first contact with openHAB. It guides you step by step in your discovery of openHAB mechanisms.

This manual is an on-going work.

<!--
Two companion books will help you while you will need more information.

The _Reference manual_ is an extensive reference of what is presented in the user’s manual. This manual is useful for you when you need to know all the details of something you have learnt in the User’s manual.

The _Cookbook_ is a set of ready-to-use (or as ready as possible) recipes and “tricks”.

For example, speaking of the scripting language:

- the _user’s manual_ presents the scripting language thru some use cases, 
- the _reference manual_ details the complete syntax,
- the _cookbook_ contains real-life use cases that you can use for your own setup.

This set of manuals is an on-going work.

# Developer Documentation

The [_Developer Guide_](developers/introduction/introduction) contains practical and technical information for people willing to contribute to the development of openHAB or of one of its add-ons.

This manual is an on-going work.
