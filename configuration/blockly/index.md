# Blockly Reference

One of the core feature that openHAB provides is writing rules to allow specific behaviour with the home automation system.
The usual way of developing rules is by coding them like described in the [Textual Rules](/docs/configuration/rules-dsl.html).

However, this art of programming may become intimidating early on and shy away away people with few or almost no experience in programming.
Therefore openHAB also provides a graphical way of writing rules which allows to put together rules in a rather visual way (even though some programming background may still help).

## Introduction

The basic idea behind the visual paradigm and representation within openHAB is based on the [Google Blockly Support](https://developers.google.com/blockly) which has been integrated and which provides the basic blocks for programming like the ones on the left and the right side of the below images
_Blockly toolbox_

![blockly-toolbox-1](../images/blockly/blockly-toolbox-1.png)![blockly-toolbox-2](../images/blockly/blockly-toolbox-2.png)![blockly-toolbox-3](../images/blockly/blockly-toolbox-3.png)

All of these provide general functionality that is not specific to openHAB itself. If you want to learn more about how to use them, search for the many blockly tutorials that are available.
However, to leverage the full capabilities more than _50 specific blocks_ have been provided that are tailored for easy access of openHAB's capabilities.

This section provides a detailed description of the specific blocks and provides examples on how to use them. Note that some of the blocks (like voice, streaming or notifications) need some special setup within openHAB  - in these case links to the respective documentation is provided.

## Looking for help

A special mention should go towards the **Help** entry in a block context menu [right click on any block](rules-blockly-before-using.html#block-context-menu) that links to a resource that is usually very helpful to understand the context of that particular block.
To retrieve the particular help for a block right click on a block to open the context menu and click on the **help**-entry:

![context-help](../images/blockly/blockly-context-help.png)

There is also a help-button available in each section that links to the documentation of the whole section.

![main-help-button](../images/blockly/blockly-main-help.png)

Please read this information first before asking questions in the forum. _In case you ask for help please always post the respective code that is being generated._

Also there is a good  intro about that topic can be viewed at ![youtube](../images/blockly/youtube-logo-small.png) [Various Help Documentation available in openHAB Blocky](https://youtu.be/EdllUlJ7p6k?t=1589)

## Blocks Overview

Also view ![youtube](../images/blockly/youtube-logo-small.png) [Overview of the Blockly Sections](https://youtu.be/EdllUlJ7p6k?t=558)

### Items and Things

_Items_ and _Things_ are the [major entities of openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/) to control and monitor the home.

[![Items and Things](../images/blockly/blockly-items-and-things-small.png "Items and Things")
](rules-blockly-items-things.html)

See [Items & Things](rules-blockly-items-things.html) section

### Timers and Delays

Timers and Delays are a little more complex but add important functionality to rules. Whilst the “Wait-For”-block is straightforward, the timer blocks should be well understood before being used - they may behave differently than expected.
This chapter explains what these blocks do, sometimes displaying generated code to explain what is happening behind the scenes.

[![Timers and Delays](../images/blockly/blockly-timers-and-delays-small.png "Items and Things")
](rules-blockly-timers-and-delays.html)

See [Timers and Delays](rules-blockly-timers-and-delays.html) section.

### Date Handling

Date blocks are used as input parameters for other blocks.
Some of these blocks are used by ephemeris blocks, whilst others are used in the persistence section. Therefore blocks are _typed_ to assure correct connection to other blocks.

[![Date Handling](../images/blockly/blockly-date-handling1-small.png "Dates part 1")
](rules-blockly-date-handling.html) [![Date Handling](../images/blockly/blockly-date-handling2-small.png "Dates Part 2")
](rules-blockly-date-handling.html)

See [Date Handling](rules-blockly-date-handling.html) section.

### Ephemeris

The ephemeris category provides blocks with calendar functionality. The blocks can be used to determine what type of day today is, or a number of days before or after today is.
For example, a way to determine if today is a weekend, a bank holiday, someone’s birthday, trash day, etc.

[![Ephemeris](../images/blockly/blockly-ephemeris-small.png "Ephemeris")
](rules-blockly-ephemeris.html)

See [Ephemeris](rules-blockly-ephemeris.html) section.

### Voice and Multimedia

This section deals with _playing or streaming audio_ to an audio sink e.g a speaker or _saying a text_ via using any Text-to-Speech API (e.g. Google's API)

[![Voice and Multimedia](../images/blockly/blockly-voice-and-multimedia-small.png "Voice and Multimedia")
](rules-blockly-voice-and-multimedia.html)

See [Voice and Multimedia](rules-blockly-voice-and-multimedia.html) section.

### Notifications

For use with your [openHAB cloud](https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/openhabcloud/) account, these blocks can be used to send notifications to relevant connected devices.
Notifications can be used as push message to devices running the openHAB client.

[![Notifications](../images/blockly/blockly-notifications-small.png "Notifications")
](rules-blockly-notifications.html)

See [Notifications](rules-blockly-notifications.html) section.

### Persistence

Persistence blocks enable access of historical data stored by the default persistence service.

[![Persistence](../images/blockly/blockly-persistence-small.png "Persistence")
](rules-blockly-persistence.html)

See [Persistence](rules-blockly-persistence.html) section.

### Value Storage

These blocks enable storing information _for a rule_ that is kept after the rule has run, so it can be reused when the rule is run again later in stateful way.

[![Value Storage](../images/blockly/blockly-value-storage-small.png "Value Storage")
](rules-blockly-value-storage.html)

See [Value Storage](rules-blockly-value-storage.html) section.

### Run & Process (Rules, Scripts and Transformations)

This section allows calling rules or other scripts, retrieving attributes provided by the rule context or transforming values via different conversion methods (e.g. map, regex, jsonpath)

[![Run & Process](../images/blockly/blockly-run-and-process-small.png "Run & Process")
](rules-blockly-run-and-process.html)

See [Run and Process](rules-blockly-run-and-process.html) section.

### Logging

This section allows calling rules or other scripts, retrieving attributes provided by the rule context or transforming values via different conversion methods (e.g. map, regex, jsonpath)

[![Logging](../images/blockly/blockly-logging-overview-small.png "Logging")
](rules-blockly-logging.html)

See [Logging](rules-blockly-logging.html) section.

### openHAB Extensions to the Standard

This section explains only the blocks that have been added to the standard blocks by openHAB

![lists-overview-concat](../images/blockly/blockly-lists-concatenate.png)
](rules-blockly-standard-ext.html)

See [openHAB Extensions to the standard](rules-blockly-standard-ext.html) section.

### openHAB Blocks provided by the community

The core openHAB are meant to cover most of the functionality that is needed to write rules.
However, there might be functionality that is not available (yet).
These can be provided by the community.

A good explanation on how to write custom blocks can be found at [How to write openHAB Blockly Libraries](https://community.openhab.org/t/tutorial-how-to-write-block-libraries/130074)

All published custom blocks can be found at [Published Blockly Libraries](https://community.openhab.org/c/marketplace/block-libraries/76) and can be directly downloaded within your openHAB installation in the [Settings -> Automation section](/docs/settings/addons.html#automation)
