# HTTP

[return to Blockly Reference](index.html#http)

## Introduction

This section explains the blocks that allow sending HTTP requests.

## HTTP Requests

There is one block that handles all type of requests.
Depending on the required functionality it changes its design.

### Option Toggles

There are three toggle buttons that allow the block to be small for simple requests and add further options to be used:

![http-toggle](../images/blockly/blockly-http-toggles.png)

- Clock: enables the timeout option
- H: enables the header option and allows to provide headers during the request via a [Dictionary](rules-blockly-standard-ext.md#dictionary-for-managing-key--value-pairs)
- Q: enables the query option and allows to provide URI query parameters during the request via a [Dictionary](rules-blockly-standard-ext.md#dictionary-for-managing-key--value-pairs), the query parameters will be URI encoded

### HTTP Request GET

_Function:_ Send an HTTP GET request to a server and receive the response

The simplest form is shown by default and accepts the destination URI as String.

![http-get-simple](../images/blockly/blockly-http-get-simple.png)

By activating the toggles the timeout, request headers and query parameters can be provided.
Instead of creating a URI containing the query parameters, you can use the query parameter option and provide a [Dictionary](rules-blockly-standard-ext.md#dictionary-for-managing-key--value-pairs) of query parameters.
The provided parameters will automatically be URI encoded.

Here is an example also using a query parameter.

See the [POST-Request](#http-request-post) below for an example showing the use additional fields.

### HTTP Request POST

_Function:_ Send an HTTP POST request to a server and receive the response

The simplest form is shown by default and accepts the destination URI as String and in comparison to the [GET-Request](#http-request-get) adds a section for the payload which takes two parameters:

- the MIME-type of the content to be sent
- the content to be sent to the destination

For MIME-type `application/json` you can provide an object as content, and it will be converted to a JSON string.
For `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, you can provide a [Dictionary](rules-blockly-standard-ext.md#dictionary-for-managing-key--value-pairs) and it will be URI encoded.

Here is a more complex example that additionally sets a header and a timeout:

### HTTP Request PUT

_Function:_ Send an HTTP PUT request to a server and receive the response

The simplest form is shown by default and accepts the destination URI as String and is similar in functionality to the [POST-Request](#http-request-post):

- the MIME-type of the content to be sent
- the content to be sent to the destination

![http-put-simple](../images/blockly/blockly-http-put-simple.png)

Notice the construction of an object with a [Dictionary](rules-blockly-standard-ext.md#dictionary-for-managing-key--value-pairs) also containing a List for the JSON payload.

### HTTP Request DELETE

_Function:_ Send an HTTP DELETE request to a server and receive the response

The simplest form is shown by default and accepts the destination URI as String.
