# Persistence

Persistence support stores item states over time (a time series).
openHAB is not restricted to a single data store.
Different stores can co-exist and be configured independently.
For further details, please check:

- [The openHAB 1.x wiki persistence article](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Persistence)
