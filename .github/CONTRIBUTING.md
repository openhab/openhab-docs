# Contribution Guidelines

## Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible.
Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request?
Do it!
We will appreciate it.

## Conventions

Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch.

Any change will be checked against selected **markdown rules**, defined in the [.markdownlint.yaml](.markdownlint.yaml), and will be automatically checked during the build.
An explanation of the rules can be found [here](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases).
Please make sure that your contributed content is therefore compliant with these rules before contributing them.
Checkout the [markdownlint project](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) for support of your favorite IDE.
In doubt, ask us to guide you on these rules.

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference to all the issues that they address.

Pull requests must not contain commits from other users or branches.

Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars) written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch.
Be sure to post a comment after pushing.
The new commits will show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you comment.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like `Closes #XXX` or `Fixes #XXX`, which will automatically close the issue when merged.

## Community Guidelines

We want to keep the openHAB community awesome, growing and collaborative.
We need your help to keep it that way.
To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

- Be nice:
  Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members:
  no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated.
  We like nice people way better than mean ones!

- Encourage diversity and participation:
  Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.

- Keep it legal:
  Basically, don't get us in trouble.
  Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the law.

- Stay on topic:
  Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions.
  Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people.
  Please consider this before you update.  Also remember that nobody likes spam.
