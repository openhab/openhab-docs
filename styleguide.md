# openHAB Documentation Style Guide 

## General Remarks

First and foremost we are following the recommendations given at: [http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/).

## Markdown Decisions

An ordered list:

1. Some text
2. Some more text

An unordered list:

- Some text
- Some more text

An unordered loose list (applied if bigger or with nested lists):

-   Some text
    - An indented item, making the list "loose"

-   Some more text

-   And even more text that could also strech over multiple lines
