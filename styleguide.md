# openHAB Documentation Style Guide

## General Remarks

First and foremost we are following the recommendations given at: [https://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/](https://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/).

## Markdown Decisions

An ordered list:

1. Some text
1. Some more text

An unordered list:

- Some text
- Some more text

An unordered loose list (applied if bigger or with nested lists):

- Some text
  - An indented item, making the list "loose"

- Some more text

- And even more text that could also stretch over multiple lines
