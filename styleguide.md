# openhab-docs Markdown StyleGuide

An ordered list:

1. Some text
2. Some more text

An unordered list:

- Some text
- Some more text

An unordered loose list (applied if bigger or with nested lists):

-   Some text
    - An indented item, making the list "loose"

-   Some more text

-   And even more text that could also strech over multiple lines
