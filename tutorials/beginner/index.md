# Overview

This part covers all the basics to use openHAB after you installed it: how to perform the first-time setup, add some bindings, discover and configure things for the first time and finally how to create a sitemap and some basic rules.

The goal of this tutorial is to cover the first steps for new users. After performing the first-time setup, you will learn how to install a very simple "binding", the "Network Binding". A binding is an additional package for openHAB to be able to interact with all kinds of devices or situations. To show you the use and configuriation of a more complex binding, we'll guide you through the installation of the "Zwave Binding", a binding to control devices in a Zwave network. At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create a local sitemap and your first simple rules.

**This tutorial assumes that you already installed openHAB on your preferred system. If you're looking for installation instructions for your platform, please have a look [here]({{base}}/installation/index.html) before continuing with this tutorial!**
