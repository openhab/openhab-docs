# Looking to the logs

While using openHAB, we will need to look at the the logs generated by the software to see if there are any issues that need your attention.

Two log files are going to interest us. The two files are called openhab.log and events.log with the events.log file showing what is happening on the Openhab event bus like sensors changing states, and the openhab.log file which shows the output of all bindings and addons.

To watch the logs in realtime with a openhabian based setup use the below linux command which can be done via SSH with a program called putty from a windows or mac machine. CTRL+C will close the stream. You can also use SAMBA/network shares to open or copy the file directly.

tail -f /var/log/openhab2/openhab.log -f /var/log/openhab2/events.log

Bindings can have the amount of information turned up or down on a per binding basis and this is done with the Karaf console. 

To find them if you are not using Openhabian:

- open the finder,
- navigate to your home folder,
- navigate inside the openHAB folder,
- navigate inside the userdata folder,
- navigate inside the logs folder

- Inside the logs folder, double-click on the `openhab.log` file. The file will be displayed inside the console application.

<!-- ![](images/log-screen.png) -->

The console will display the messages as soon as they will be logged.
Keep this window somewhere in order to take a look inside when it is needed.
We will use it to check the Z-Wave dialogs.

A "clean" startup looks this way in the log file :

```java
2016-05-09 21:29:33.195 [INFO ] [arthome.ui.paper.internal.PaperUIApp] - Started Paper UI at /ui
2016-05-09 21:29:33.252 [INFO ] [.dashboard.internal.DashboardService] - Started dashboard at /start
2016-05-09 21:29:33.567 [INFO ] [ing.zwave.handler.ZWaveSerialHandler] - Serial port is initialized
```
