# Looking to the logs

While using openHAB, we will need to look the the logs generated by the software.

Two log files are going to interest us.

To find them:

- open the finder,
- navigate to your home folder,
- navigate inside the openHAB folder,
- navigate inside the userdata folder,
- navigate inside the logs folder

<!-- ![](images/log-folders.png) -->

- Inside the logs folder, double-click on the `openhab.log` file. The file will be displayed inside the console application.

<!-- ![](images/log-screen.png) -->

The console will display the messages as soon as they will be logged.
Keep this window somewhere in order to take a look inside when it is needed.
We will use it to check the Z-Wave dialogs.

A "clean" startup looks this way in the log file :

```java
2016-05-09 21:29:33.195 [INFO ] [arthome.ui.paper.internal.PaperUIApp] - Started Paper UI at /ui
2016-05-09 21:29:33.252 [INFO ] [.dashboard.internal.DashboardService] - Started dashboard at /start
2016-05-09 21:29:33.567 [INFO ] [ing.zwave.handler.ZWaveSerialHandler] - Serial port is initialized
```
