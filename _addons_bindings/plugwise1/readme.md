# Plugwise Binding

The Plugwise binding adds support to openHAB for [Plugwise](https://www.plugwise.com) ZigBee devices using the Stick. 

The binding supports the following Plugwise devices:

* [Circle](https://www.plugwise.com/products/appliances-and-lighting/energy-meters-and-switches/circle), a power outlet plug that provides energy measurement and switching control of appliances
* [Circle+](https://www.plugwise.com/products/appliances-and-lighting/energy-meters-and-switches/circle), a special Circle that coordinates the ZigBee network and acts as network gateway
* [Scan](https://www.plugwise.com/products/appliances-and-lighting/presence-and-light-sensor/scan), a wireless motion (PIR) and light sensor
* [Sense](https://www.plugwise.com/products/indoor-climate/humidity-and-temperature-sensor/sense), a wireless temperature and humidity sensor
* [Stealth](https://www.plugwise.com/products/appliances-and-lighting/energy-meters-and-switches/stealth), a Circle with a more compact form factor that can be built-in
* [Stick](https://www.plugwise.com/home-start), the ZigBee USB controller that openHAB uses to communicate with the Circle+
* [Switch](https://www.plugwise.com/products/appliances-and-lighting/energy-meters-and-switches/switch), a wireless wall switch 

Users should use the Plugwise [Source](https://www.plugwise.com/source) software to define the network, reset devices, perform firmware upgrade, and so forth, e.g. anything which requires user input or interactivity. 

> Currently only "V2" of the Plugwise protocol is supported. It is adviced that users of the binding upgrade their devices to the latest firmware using the Plugwise Source software.

## Binding Configuration

### Stick configuration

This binding can be configured in the file `services/plugwise.cfg`. You can also configure the Stick in Paper UI via `Configuration > Bindings > Plugwise Binding > Configure`.  

> There is currently a potential issue in openHAB 2 that when you rename or remove devices from `services/plugwise.cfg` they are still persisted in openHAB. To fix this, enter `config:delete Plugwise` in the openHAB console and restart openHAB. This will clear the persisted Plugwise configuration and reload it from `services/plugwise.cfg`.

Before the binding can be used, the serial port of the Stick needs to be configured. This is done by uncommenting `stick.port` and assigning a proper value to it in the (binding) configuration file:

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| stick.port |       |    Yes   | the serial port of the Stick, e.g. "COM1" for Windows or "/dev/ttyUSB0" for Linux.<br/><br/>To determine the serial port in Linux, insert the Stick, then execute the `dmesg` command. The last few lines of the output will contain the USB port of the Stick (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`). In Windows the Device Manager lists it in the `Ports (COM & LPT)` section. On some Linux distributions (e.g. Raspbian) an OS restart may be required before the Stick is properly configured. To access the serial port of the Stick on Linux, the user running openHAB needs to be part of the 'dialout' group. E.g. for the user 'openhab' issue the following command: `sudo adduser openhab dialout`. openHAB may need to be restarted when you change the `stick.port` or device configurations. |
|stick.interval | 150 |   No    | interval in milliseconds to wait between messages sent on the ZigBee network |


### Device configuration

The Plugwise device configuration is also stored in the (binding) configuration. The configuration file also allows you to assign names to MAC addresses of Plugwise devices. This makes item configurations easier to understand.

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| `<id>`.mac |       |   Yes    | MAC address of the Plugwise device associated with the ID `<id>`. The MACs are stickered to the back of Plugwise devices. The binding uses full MACs i.e. also the fine print on the sticker. If you don't want to get off your chair, climb up ladders and unplug devices all across your home, causing all sorts of havoc; you can also find them in Source. Open `Settings > Appliances`. Then double click on an appliance. Click on the little Circle icon to the right of the short Address to see the details of a module and the full MAC (Address). Similarly the MACs of a Scan, Sense and Switch can also be obtained from the Appliances screen by double clicking them in the `Sensors and other modules` list. |
| `<id>`.type | circle | No | one of `circleplus`, `circle`, `scan`, `sense`, `switch` |

where `<id>` is a name you choose to identify a specific Plugwise device.  You may not use `stick` as an `<id>`.  Repeat the configuration with a different value `<id>` to configure multiple devices.


## Item Configuration

The Plugwise binding connects Plugwise devices to openHAB items. This is done using a binding specific syntax in the openHAB item configuration files. The item configuration files are stored in:

The syntax below uses the following elements:

* `<command>` is an `OnOff` type command/variable, i.e. either `ON` or `OFF`
* `<plugwise id>` corresponds with the device name (from the device configuration, i.e. `plugwise:<plugwise id>.mac=[MAC]`) or the full MAC address    
* `<plugwise command>` is the command to be send to the Plugwise device when `<command>` is received
* `<plugwise variable>` is a device status variable polled or pushed from the device and stored in an Item
* `<polling interval>` is the interval in seconds to poll the given variable

### Polled state 

Mains powered devices (Circle(+), Stealth) are polled by the binding for their state. 

The syntax for items that trigger `OnOff` commands is:

```
plugwise="[<command>:<plugwise id>:<plugwise command>:<polling interval>], [<command>:<plugwise id>:<plugwise command>:<polling interval>], ..."
```

***

The syntax for items that store a device status variable is:

```
plugwise="[<plugwise id>:<plugwise variable>:<polling interval>], [<plugwise id>:<plugwise variable>:<polling interval>], ..."
```

### Pushed state 

Battery powered devices (Scan, Sense, Switch) push their state to the binding. 

The syntax for items that have an `OnOff` state have is:

```
plugwise="[<command>:<plugwise id>:<plugwise variable>], [<command>:<plugwise id>:<plugwise variable>], ..."
```

***

The syntax for items that store a device status variable is:

```
plugwise="[<plugwise id>:<plugwise variable>], [<plugwise id>:<plugwise variable>], ..."
```

### Commands

Valid `<plugwise command>`'s are:

| Command | Item Type | Description | Supported devices |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| state   | Switch    | Switch the internal relay On or Off | Circle(+), Stealth |

### Variables

Valid `<plugwise variable>`s are:

| Command | Item Type | Description | Supported devices |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| clock   | String    | Time as indicated by the internal clock of the device | Circle(+), Stealth |
| lasthour | Number   | Energy consumption over the last hour, in kWh | Circle(+), Stealth |
| lasthour-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last hourly energy consumption history entry | Circle(+), Stealth |
| power   | Number    | Current energy consumption, measured over 1 second interval, in Watt | Circle(+), Stealth |
| power-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last energy consumption measurement | Circle(+), Stealth |
| realtime-clock | DateTime | Date/Time as indicated by the internal clock of the Circle+ | Circle+ |
| lastseen | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last received message. Because there is no battery level indication this is a helpful value to determine if a battery powered device is still operating properly even when no state changes occur | Scan, Sense, Switch |
| triggered | Switch  | Most recent switch action initiated by the device. When daylight override is enabled on a Scan this corresponds one to one with motion detection | Scan, Sense |
| triggered-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last trigger state update | Scan, Sense |
| humidity | Number   | Current relative humidity (%) | Sense |
| humidity-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last relative humidity measurement | Sense |
| temperature | Number | Current temperature (Â°C) | Sense |
| temperature-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last temperature measurement | Sense |
| left-button-state | Switch | Current state of the left button | Switch |
| left-button-state-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last left button state update | Switch |
| right-button-state | Switch | Current state of the right button | Switch |
| right-button-state-stamp | DateTime | Date/Time stamp of the last right button state update | Switch |

### Using MAC Address in Item

A MAC can be used instead of a device name, e.g. `fan` can be replaced with `000D6F0000A2B2C2`:

```
Number Fan_Power "Power [%.1f W]" <energy> { plugwise="[000D6F0000A2B2C2:power:10]" }`
```

## Full Example

services/plugwise.cfg

```
# you can also name your device circleplus and omit the line specifying the circleplus type (backwards compatibility)
lamp.mac=000D6F0000A1B1C1
lamp.type=circleplus

# the default device type is circle, so in this case the type could be ommitted (backwards compatibility)
fan.mac=000D6F0000A2B2C2
fan.type=circle

motionsensor.mac=000D6F0000A3B3C3
motionsensor.type=scan

climatesensor.mac=000D6F0000A4B4C4
climatesensor.type=sense

fridge.mac=000D6F0000A5B5C5
fridge.type=stealth

lightswitches.mac=000D6F0000A6B6C6
