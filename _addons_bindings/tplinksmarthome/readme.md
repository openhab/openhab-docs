# TPLinkSmartHome Binding

This binding adds support to control TP-Link Smart Home Devices from your local openHAB system.

## Supported Things

The following TP-Link Smart Devices are supported:

### LB100 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb with Dimmable Light

* Switch On/Off
* Adjust the brightness
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

Switching and Brightness is done using the `brightness` channel.

### LB110 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb with Dimmable Light

* Switch On/Off
* Adjust the brightness
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

Switching and Brightness is done using the `brightness` channel.

### LB120 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb with Tunable White Light

* Switch On/Off
* Adjust light appearance from soft white (2700k) to daylight (6500k)
* Adjust the brightness
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

Switching and Brightness is done using the `brightness` channel.

### LB130 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb with Color Changing Hue

* Switch On/Off
* Fine-tune colors
* Adjust light appearance from soft white (2500k) to daylight (9000k)
* Adjust the brightness
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

Switching, Brightness and Color is done using the `color` channel.

### HS105 and HS100 Smart Wi-Fi Plug

* Switch On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

### HS110 Smart Wi-Fi Plug

* Switch On/Off
* Energy readings
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

### HS200 Smart Wi-Fi Switch

* Switch On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

The default refresh is set to 1 second. So it polls the switch for status changes. If you don't use the switch manually
often, you can set it to a higher refresh. The refresh is only relevant to detect manual using the switch. Switching
via openHAB activates the switch directly.

### RE270K AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender with Smart Plug

* Switch On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

### RE370K AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender with Smart Plug

* Switch On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal strength (rssi)

## Prerequisites

Before using Smart Plugs with openHAB the devices must be connected to the Wi-Fi network. This can be done using the
TP-Link provided mobile app Kasa.

## Discovery

Devices can be auto discovered in the same local network as the openHAB application. It's possible to connect to
devices in a different network, but these must be added manually.

## Thing Configuration

The thing id is the product type in lower case. For example `HS100` has id `hs100`.

The thing has a few configuration parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ipAddress          | IP Address of the device. Mandatory.                                        |
| refresh            | Refresh interval in seconds. Optional, the default value is 30 seconds.     |
| transitionPeriod   | Duration of state changes in milliseconds, only for light bulbs, default 0. |

## Channels

All devices support some of the following channels:

| Channel Type ID  | Item Type | Description                                    | Thing types supporting this channel                             |
