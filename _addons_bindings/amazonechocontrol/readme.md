# Amazon Echo Control Binding

This binding can control Amazon Echo devices (Alexa).

It provides features to control and view the current state of echo devices:

- use echo device as text to speech from a rule
- volume
- pause/continue/next track/previous track
- connect/disconnect bluetooth devices
- start playing tuneIn radio
- start playing Amazon Music
- control of multi room music
- show album art image in sitemap
- speak a reminder message
- plays an alarm sound
- start traffic news
- start daily briefing
- start weather report
- start good morning report
- start automation routine
- activate multiple configurations of flash briefings
- start playing music by providing the voice command as text (Works with all music providers)

Some ideas what you can do in your home by using rules and other openHAB controlled devices:

- Automatic turn on your amplifier and connect echo with bluetooth if the echo plays music
- If the amplifier was turned of, the echo stop playing and disconnect the bluetooth
- The echo starts playing radio if the light was turned on
- The echo starts playing radio at specified time 
- Remind you with a voice message, that a window is open for a long time and it is winter
- Start a routine which welcome you, if you come home
- Start a routine which switch a smart home device connected to alexa
- Start your briefing if you turn on the light first time in the morning
- Have different flash briefing in the morning and evening
- Let alexa say 'welcome' to you if you open the door

## Note

This binding uses the same API as the Web-Browser-Based Alexa site (alexa.amazon.de).
In other words, it simulates a user which is using the web page.
Unfortunately, the binding can get broken if Amazon change the web site.

The binding is tested with amazon.de, amazon.com and amazon.co.uk accounts, but should also work with all others. 

## Warning

For the connection to the Amazon server, your password of the Amazon account is required, this will be stored in your openHAB thing device configuration.
So you should be sure, that nobody other has access to your configuration! 

## What Else You Should Know

All the display options are updated by polling the amazon server.
The polling time can be configured, but a minimum of 10 seconds is required.
The default is 60 seconds, which means the it can take up to 60 seconds to see the correct state.
It's not know, if there is a limit implemented in the amazon server if the polling is too fast and maybe amazon will lock your account. 30 seconds seems to be safe.

## Supported Things

| Thing type id        | Name                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| account              | Amazon Account                        |
| echo                 | Amazon Echo Device                    |
| echospot             | Amazon Echo Spot Device               |
| echoshow             | Amazon Echo Show Device               |
| wha                  | Amazon Echo Whole House Audio Control |
| flashbriefingprofile | Flash briefing profile                |

## First Steps

1) Create an 'Amazon Account' thing
2) Configure your credentials in the account thing (2 factor authentication is not supported!)
3) After confirmation:
a) the 'Account Thing' goes Online -> continue with 4)
b) the 'Account Thing' stays offline:  
open the url YOUR_OPENHAB/amazonechocontrol in your browser (e.g. http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/), click the link for your account thing and try to login.
4) The echo device things get automatically discovered and can be accepted

## Discovery

After configuration of the account thing with the login data, the echo devices registered in the amazon account, get discovered.
If the device type is not known by the binding, the device will not be discovered.
But you can define any device listed in your alexa app with the best matching existing device (e.g. echo).
You will find the required serial number in settings of the device in the alexa app.

## Binding Configuration

The binding does not have any configuration.
The configuration of your amazon account must be done in the 'Amazon Account' device.

## Thing Configuration

The Amazon Account thing needs the following configurations:

| Configuration name       | Description                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| amazonSite               | The amazon site where the echos are registered. e.g. amazon.de            |
| email                    | Email of your amazon account                                              |
| password                 | Password of your amazon account                                           |
| pollingIntervalInSeconds | Polling interval for the device state in seconds. Default 30, minimum 10  |

IMPORTANT: If the Account thing does not go online and reports a login error, read the instructions in "First Steps" above.

### Amazon Devices

All Amazon devices (echo, echospot, echoshow, wha) needs the following configurations:

| Configuration name       | Description                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| serialNumber             | Serial number of the amazon echo in the Alexa app  |

You will find the serial number in the alexa app or on the webpage YOUR_OPENHAB/amazonechocontrol/YOUR_ACCOUNT (e.g. http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/account1).

### Flash Briefing Profile

The flashbriefingprofile thing has no configuration parameters.
It will be configured at runtime by using the save channel to store the current flash briefing configuration in the thing.

## Channels

## How To Get IDs 

1) Open the url YOUR_OPENHAB/amazonechocontrol in your browser (e.g. http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/)
2) Click on the name of the account thing
3) Click on the name of the echo thing 
4) Scroll to the channel and copy the required ID

## Tutorials

### Let alexa speak a text from a rule:

1) Create a rule with a trigger of your choice

```php
rule "Say welcome if the door opens"
when
    Item Door_Contact changed to OPEN
then
    Echo_Living_Room_TTS.sendCommand('Hello World')
end
```

## Playing an alarm sound for 15 seconds with an openHAB rule if an door contact was opened:

1) Do get the ID of your sound, follow the steps in "How To Get IDs"
2) Write down the text in the square brackets. e.g. ECHO:system_alerts_repetitive01 for the nightstand sound
3) Create a rule for start playing the sound:

```php
var Timer stopAlarmTimer = null

rule "Turn on alarm sound for 15 seconds if door opens"
when
    Item Door_Contact changed to OPEN
then
    Echo_Living_Room_PlayAlarmSound.sendCommand('ECHO:system_alerts_repetitive01')
    if (stopAlarmTimer === null)
    {
        stopAlarmTimer = createTimer(now.plusSeconds(15)) [|
            stopAlarmTimer.cancel()
            stopAlarmTimer = null
            Echo_Living_Room_PlayAlarmSound.sendCommand('')
        ]
    }
end
```

Note 1: Do not use a to short time for playing the sound, because alexa needs some time to start playing the sound.
It's not recommended to use a time below 10 seconds.

Note 2: The rule have no effect for your default alarm sound used in the alexa app.

### Play a spotify playlist if a switch was changed to on:

1) Do get the ID of your sound, follow the steps in "How To Get IDs"
2) Write down the text in the square brackets. e.g. SPOTIFY for the spotify music provider
3) Create a rule for start playing a song or playlist:

```php
rule "Play a playlist on spotify if a switch was changed"
when
    Item Spotify_Playlist_Switch changed to ON
then
    Echo_Living_Room_PlayMusicProvider.sendCommand('SPOTIFY')
    Echo_Living_Room_PlayMusicCommand.sendCommand('Playlist Party')
end
```

Note: It's recommended to test the command send to play music command first with the voice and the real alexa device. E.g. say 'Alexa, Playlist Party'

### Start playing weather/traffic/etc:

1) Pick up one of the available commands: Weather, Traffic, GoodMorning, SingASong, TellStory, FlashBriefing
