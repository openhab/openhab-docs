No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/181) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the NQ-9022 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | Temperature | Number | 

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Clock Time Offset

Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
