The NQ-9121 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The NQ-9121 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Power Reader is a metering device capable of counting pulses from any electricity or gas meters. The device stores timestamped consumption in its internal memory every 15 minutes. Note: The Power Reader for electricity metering has different firmware than the Power Reader for gas metering. Please make sure you have the appropriate firmware on your device before you start integrating / installing it. 

### Inclusion Information

In order to include the Power/Gas Reader in a Z-Wave network, the device must first have its network settings cleared. New devices fulfil this requirement be default. Power Readers with firmware version up to 3.24 and Gas Readers with firmware version up to 3.30 can have their network settings cleared by pressing 7 times on the button, however it is not recommended to do so because the Z-Wave controller will not be informed that the device has been reset. Power Readers with firmware version equal or larger than 3.29 and Gas Readers with firmware version equal or larger than 3.34 do not reset their network settings if the button has been pressed 7 times. To clear them, any Z-Wave controller must be placed in Exclusion mode first and the button on the device must be pressed 3 times.

### Exclusion Information

In order to exclude the Power/Gas Reader from a Z-Wave network, place the controller in remove mode first and then press the button on the device 3 times.

### Wakeup Information

The NQ-9121 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The Power Reader has two functioning modes:

  * Real-time mode: the device will be awake and keep the antenna on. It will stay in real-time a predefined number of seconds (900).
  * Normal mode: the device will be in sleep and only wake up according to the interval defined by the WAKE UP SET command.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the NQ-9121 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Gas meter (cubic meters) | meter_gas_cubic_meters | meter_gas_cubic_meters | Energy | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | time_offset | Temperature | Number | 

### Gas meter (cubic meters)
Indicates the gas use in cubic meters.

The ```meter_gas_cubic_meters``` channel is of type ```meter_gas_cubic_meters``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Clock Time Offset
Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel is of type ```time_offset``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the NQ-9121.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Pulse factor | Impulse or Rotation factor (see NorthQ docs for Gas meters) |
| 2 | Sensor type | Defines the type of sensor |
| 9 | Pulse count | This register holds the total number of pulses. |
| 10 | Keep alive period | How many ticks before going back to sleep in normal wakeup mode. |
| 11 | Real-time mode | Set this to enter real-time mode from remote. |
| 12 | Serial number | Read-only serial number in decimal |
| 15 | Calibration status | Aplies to devices with firmware version 3.30 or higher |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Pulse factor

Impulse or Rotation factor (see NorthQ docs for Gas meters)
Register 1 - Pulse factor (4 byte register) - In this register the controlling node must set the meter's impulse or rotation factor x 10.

Example: For a gas meter read using the silver spot on one of the digits, the value written in this register is calculated with the following formula: Pulse factor = 10^?, where X is the index of the digit that has the silver spot.

For a gas meter read through magnetic contact, the impulse factor is usually expressed as 1 imp = 0.01 m3, which correlates to 100 impulses for 1 m3. The value written in this register will therefore be 1000 (100*10).This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 1000000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Sensor type

Defines the type of sensor
Register 2 - sensor type (1 byte register) - In this register, the controlling node has to set the meter type on which the Power Reader is placed.

For gas firmware: set 0x01 to this register for magnetic contact meters, or 0x02 for silver spot meters.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | magnetic contact |
| 2 | silver spot meter |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (silver spot meter).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Pulse count

This register holds the total number of pulses.
Register 9 - pulse count (4 byte register) - This register holds the total number of pulses. Use this register to set the total meter consumption. In order for the Power/Gas Reader to report the proper total meter consumption, the value for this registered has to be initialized with meter value * impulse factor.

Ex: For a mechanical meter with a rotation factor of 150 and the total meter consumption 100.3, the value written in this register must be: 15045 (150 x 100.3). The total meter consumption written on the meter can be a user input variable at installation.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 2147483647 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Keep alive period

How many ticks before going back to sleep in normal wakeup mode.
Register 10 - keep alive period (2 byte register) - At every wake up notification, the Power Reader stays alive for 3 seconds. If the controlling node can't guarantee a response for the Power Reader within 3 seconds, then this register should be set to the number of seconds that it will take the controlling node to send a response / request to the wake up notification.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: Real-time mode

Set this to enter real-time mode from remote.
Register 11 - real-time register (2 bytes) - This register notifies the controlling mode when the real-time mode has started and when it ended. The configuration report contains the number of seconds * 20 left until the real-time mode is over. A configuration report with value 0 notifies the controlling node that the Power Reader is going to normal mode.

NOTE: The wake up no more information has no effect in real-time mode. In order to tell the Power Reader to go to sleep from real-time mode, the controlling node has to set this register to value 0.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 12: Serial number

Read-only serial number in decimal
Register 12 - serial number (4 bytes) - This register contains the serial number of the Power Reader. 

NOTE: The serial numbers written on the Power Reader are in HEX, not decimal.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 15: Calibration status

Aplies to devices with firmware version 3.30 or higher
Register 15 - calibration status (4 byte) - A configuration report with this register will inform the controlling node of its current calibration status on the meter.

**Only applies to gas readers with firmware version 3.30 or higher configured for SILVER SPOT!**

Setting the value 0 on this register will restart the calibration process will restart the calibration process that occurs normally at power-up. The calibration process lasts approx. 2 minutes. Interrogating this register will return the current calibration percentage, from 0 to 100, value 100 indicating that the calibration has ended.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
