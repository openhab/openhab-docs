The HS-DS100+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HS-DS100+ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

HS-DS100+ is a battery operated sensor that is designed to issue Z-Wave commands when doors or windows are opened or closed. HSDS100+ may be associated directly with other Z-Wave devices or it may be used with a wide variety of Z-Wave hubs and controllers to trigger events, scenes and other automations.

### Inclusion Information

1. Ensure AAA batteries are installed. Pull plastic tab from battery compartment (if necessary)
2. Put your home automation controller into ‘inclusion’ mode. Consult your system’s manual for details.
3. HS-DS100+ may be included “securely” (option a) or “non-securely” (option b). If your automation controller does not support secure devices, or if you wish to improve battery life, add the sensor “non-securely”. Otherwise, include the sensor “securely” 
  - a) Secure inclusion: Press and hold the Z-Wave button inside the sensor body for 3 seconds. Wait for the process to finish.
  - b) Non-Secure inclusion: Triple-click the Z-Wave button inside the sensor body. Wait for the process to finish.
4. If successful, the sensor body LED will blink briefly and then stay on for 3 seconds. If unsuccessful, the LED with blink briefly and then turn off. Should this happen, repeat the inclusion process.

Note: If you want this Door/window sensor to function as a security device using secure/encrypted Z-Wave communications, then a security enabled Z-Wave controller is required.

### Exclusion Information

1\. Put your home automation controller into ‘exclusion’ mode. Consult your system’s manual for details.

2\. Triple-click the Z-Wave button inside the sensor body. If successful, the LED will turn off within 1 second. If unsuccessful, the LED with blink for 5 seconds. Should this happen, repeat the exclusion process.

### Wakeup Information

The HS-DS100+ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HS-DS100+ -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Tamper Alarm

Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Door Sensor

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the HS-DS100+.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 14 | Enable / Disable BASIC SET command | Enable / Disable BASIC SET command |
| 15 | Value of BASIC SET |  |
| 32 | Defines value of LOW BATTERY | Defines value of LOW BATTERY |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 14: Enable / Disable BASIC SET command

Enable / Disable BASIC SET command
A setting of “0” disables the regular reporting feature and requires the sensor to be manually woken up to send updates.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: Value of BASIC SET



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Sends 255 value for open and 0 value for closed |
| 1 | Sends 0 value for open and 255 value for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Sends 255 value for open and 0 value for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 32: Defines value of LOW BATTERY

Defines value of LOW BATTERY

Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_32_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-DS100+ supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


This group supports 5 nodes.
