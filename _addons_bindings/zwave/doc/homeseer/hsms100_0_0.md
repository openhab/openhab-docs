The HS-MS100+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HS-MS100+ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Motion sensor can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices.   
The features list:   
1\) Z-Wave Plus certified for wide compatibility (500 serials product)  
2\) Supports security 0 and security 2 protected mode with AES-128 encryption.   
3\) Motion sensor.   
4\) Tamper alarm by shock sensor.

7\) Support firmware OTA.

### Inclusion Information

1\) Open the cover

2\) Place the device withing the direct range of your Z-Wave controller

3\) Set the main controller into inclusion mode

4a) "Secure Inclusion". Hold Z-button for 5 sec and then release. The LED indicator should blink fast.

4b) "Non-secure Inclusion". Press Z-button once. The LED indicator should blink fast.

5\) Wait for the adding process to end

### Exclusion Information

2\) Place the device withing the direct range of your Z-Wave controller

3\) Set the main controller into exclusion mode

4a) Triple click Z-button quickly. The LED indicator should blink fast.

5\) Wait for the removing process to end

### Wakeup Information

The HS-MS100+ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Press and hold Z button for more than 5 seconds and release

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HS-MS100+ -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (burglar)

Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the HS-MS100+.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 12 | Motion sensor sensitivity | Motion sensor sensitivity |
| 14 | Enable/Disable BASIC SET command | Enable/Disable BASIC SET command |
| 15 | Value of the BASIC SET | Value of the BASIC SET |
| 17 | Enable/ Disable shock alarm | Enable/ Disable shock alarm |
| 18 | Motion timeout interval | Motion timeout interval |
| 32 | Level of low battery | Level of low battery |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 12: Motion sensor sensitivity

Motion sensor sensitivity
The higher the value, the more sensitive the PIR sensor.
Values in the range 1 to 8 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```8```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 14: Enable/Disable BASIC SET command

Enable/Disable BASIC SET command

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: Value of the BASIC SET

Value of the BASIC SET

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Triggered value 255 |
| 1 | Triggered value 0 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Triggered value 255).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 17: Enable/ Disable shock alarm

Enable/ Disable shock alarm

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not send a vibration alarm |
| 1 | Send a vibration alarm |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Send a vibration alarm).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_17_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 18: Motion timeout interval

Motion timeout interval
Set 0 to disable report.

Value 1 to 65535 set timeout of transmitting command when motion has not been sensed for a period of time
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```600```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_18_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 32: Level of low battery

Level of low battery
The low level from 10% to 50%
Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_32_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-MS100+ supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


This group supports 5 nodes.
