The HS-LS100+ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HS-LS100+ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Homeseer HS-LS100+ is a compact, easy to install leak sensor. It designed control other ZLS100+ is a compact, easy to install leak sensor. It designed control other Z-Wave devices directly or it may be used with a variety of Z-Wave certified home controllers to launch automation events or scenes.

### Inclusion Information

Inclusion (recommended if your home controller supports “S0” or “S2” Z-Wave encryption)  
1. Put your home controller into Z-Wave ‘inclusion’ mode.  
2. Quickly triple-press the Z-Wave network button, then release it. Wait for the inclusion process to finish.

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion  
1. Put your home automation controller into Z-Wave ‘exclusion’ mode.  
2. Quickly triple-press the Z-Wave network button. Wait for the exclusion process to finish.

### Wakeup Information

The HS-LS100+ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press and hold the Z button for more that 5 seconds and release

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-LS100+ supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. Notification Report. Sensor will send Notification Report to the associated nodes

2. Battery Report. Sensor will send Battery Report when the battery level is low and the battery report’s value is 0xFF.

3. Device Reset Locally Notification. Sensor will send Device Reset Locally Notification when reset

4.Sensor multilevel report When associated to Group 1, you can adjust the temperature reporting cycle according to the configuration settings.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control

1. Basic Set. Flood Sensor will send Basic Set to associated nodes when Water leak detected.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
