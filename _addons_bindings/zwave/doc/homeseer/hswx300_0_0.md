The HS-WX300 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

HS-WX300 is a Z-Wave in-wall light switch that may be configured to operate as either a dimmer switch or an on/off switch. It may be installed with or without a neutral wire and it works with both wired and wireless companion switches in 3-way circuit configurations.

### Inclusion Information

Follow this 2-step procedure to add (or remove) your new HomeSeer switch to (or from) your Z-Wave network:

Put your Z-Wave controller into inclusion (or exclusion) mode.

In rapid succession, tap the bottom paddle 2 times, then press & hold the bottom paddle for 3 seconds (tap-tap-press & hold). This will initiate the inclusion (or exclusion) process.

### Exclusion Information

Same procedure as Inclusion.

(Note: The switch will default to dimmer mode after Z-Wave exclusion.)

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS-WX300 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline association only supports the "manual reset" event.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Companion Sync

Any device added to group 2 will be controlled. This allows other WX300 devices to used as companion switches. LEDS will be kept in sync.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
