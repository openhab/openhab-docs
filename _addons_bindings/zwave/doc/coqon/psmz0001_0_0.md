# PSMZ0001 Plug module
This describes the Z-Wave device *PSMZ0001*, manufactured by *Coqon* with the thing type UID of ```coqon_psmz0001_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Power Outlet*, defining Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there.

The PSMZ0001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Power Plug with Energy Monitoring,

### Inclusion Information

When a PSMZ0001 that is not associated to a Z-Wave Network, is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. The PSMZ0001 can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:

  1. start inclusion/exclusion on the primary controller
  2. hold the touch button until the led shows green light
  3. release the touch button. The PSMZ0001 will confirm successful addition to the network by 5 green flashes.

### Exclusion Information

When a PSMZ0001 that is not associated to a Z-Wave network is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. The PSMZ0001 can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:

  1. start inclusion/exclusion on the primary controller
  2. hold the touch button until the led shows green light
  3. release the touch button. The PSMZ0001will confirm successful removal/exclusion by steady red flashing. At the time of exclusion the device is factory reset.

### Wakeup Information

The PSMZ0001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PSMZ0001 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the PSMZ0001.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 31 | Local Control | Local Control ON/OFF |

### Parameter 31: Local Control

Local Control ON/OFF
f LocalControlOn is set (factory default state) the PMSZ001s output can be switched manually by the touch button. If LocalControlOff is set, the PMSZ0001s output can only be switched through Z-Wave telegrams. In both modes the operational state of the mechanical switch is reported to association group 2
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Local Control On |
| 1 | Local Control Off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Local Control On).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSMZ0001 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: SwitchInput


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
