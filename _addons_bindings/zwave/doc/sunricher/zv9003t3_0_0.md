The ZV9003T3-RGBW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This wall controller is a Security Enabled Z-Wave Plus device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. The wall controller can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

Although it is controlling other devices, the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary), so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the device. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.

The wall controller has following functions:

  1. Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF', Dim and Color Control commands.
  2. Activation of scenes in Gateways.

The encryption modes that the wall controller supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the wall controller is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2. Make sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of the manual).
  3. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful inclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

Method 2: Factory reset the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of the manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### General Usage Information

**How to check whether the wall controller already included to a network**

  * Operate any button to check if there is indication from the LED indicator, and no LED indication means the wall controller does not belong to any network.
  * If the wall controller already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network. Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail.

**Factory Reset**

  * Press and hold down “inclusion/exclusion” button for over 8 seconds, LED indicator blinks slowly to indicate successful factory reset, release “inclusion/exclusion” button, the wall controller will restart automatically.

**Association**

  * Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is called association. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of devices that will receive controlling commands.
  * These lists are called association groups and they are always related to certain events (e.g. button pressed). In case the event happens all devices stored in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command.

**About Scene Command Types**

  * Configure the remote via gateway with CC COMMAND\_CLASS\_ASSOCIATION or COMMAND\_CLASS\_MULTI\_CHANNEL\_ASSOCIATION to associate controllable devices with remote.
  * Configure the remote via gateway with CC COMMAND\_CLASS\_ASSOCIATION or COMMAND\_CLASS\_MULTI\_CHANNEL\_ASSOCIATION to associate controllable devices from remote.
  * Note: all configuration parameters for association will be removed automatically after the remote is removed from the network.

**About Scene Command Targets**

  * Z-Wave has two types of mainstream scene commands: CENTRAL SCENE and SCENE ACTIVATION, and scene commands can either be emitted to controlled devices or to Z-Wave gateway.  

**Control Devices Associated With This Controller**

(Note: All association information will be cleared automatically once the wall controller is excluded from a network.)

  * Associations can be assigned and remove either via Z-Wave commands or using the device itself.
  * This remote uses CONFIGURATION PARAMETER 3 to determine which of the possible command types to emit scene commands with.
  * This remote uses CONFIGURATION PARAMETER 4 to determine which of the possible device types to emit scene commands to.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9003T3-RGBW -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer Level | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | thermostat_mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Color | color_color | color_color | ColorLight | Color | 
| Temperature | color_temperature | color_temperature | ColorLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Dimmer Level
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
This device's behavior with regard to its three scene buttons changes along with the value of parameter 3.  Given its default value of 0, triggering a scene button causes the device to emit a CENTRAL\_SCENE command to report the event.  If the value of parameter 3 is changed to 1, the device's behavior also changes to use this channel's SCENE\_ACTIVATION command instead.

Both commands fire a channel named _scene_number_, but only one instance of a channel with any name can exist in the database.  Since the factory default for this device is associated with CENTRAL_SCENE, that command defines the _scene_number_ channel.  If a user intends to operate this device using the SCENE_ACTIVATION command mode, it may be necessary to alter the channel names as released in order for the state of the channel actively in use to be displayed accurately.

Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel is of type ```thermostat_mode``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9003T3-RGBW supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
**Lifeline — Group 1** 

This group supports one node, with its default association assigned to Master Controller node after inclusion.

Used by controlled devices to report state to Master Controller if any changes happen.

Send Command Class Device Reset Locally to Group 1’s associated device to achieve a factory reset of wall controller.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Launch 1

Controlled Device Association
**Launch Association -- Group 2**

Association Group 2 supports up to 12 controllable devices. 

  * Associated devices may also be simultaneously associated with other remotes.
  * Once remote and controllable devices are both added to same network, use your gateway or hub interface to associate device with remote using association group 2. Please refer to gateway’s user manual to learn how.
  * Disassociate controllable devices no longer in working status from remote for best control experience.

Following command types are sent to nodes in Association Group 2

  * Basic Set
  * Switch Multilevel Start Level Change
  * Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change
  * Switch Multilevel Set
  * Switch Color Set
  * Central Scene Notification -or- Scene Activation
