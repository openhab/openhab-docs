The ZV9101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The LED dimmer is a Z-Wave device that is used to switch ON/OFF, adjust light intensity and RGB color of the connected RGBW LED light and can be controlled by other Z-Wave devices. The dimmer can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. the device cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary), so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the device. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade. The encryption modes that the LED dimmer supports are S0, S2 Unauthenticated. When the LED dimmer is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2. Power on the LED dimmer, make sure the LED dimmer does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the LED dimmer included to a network” of the manual).
  3. When the connected LED light flashes quickly for 6 seconds, it means the LED dimmer does not belong to any network. Triple press the “Inclusion/Exclusion” button, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.
  4. When the connected LED light is under solid on status, it means the LED dimmer has already been included into a network. First you have to set the LED dimmer into exclusion mode, once excluded, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.

The connected LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Triple press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, the LED dimmer will be set to exclusion mode, the connected LED light will flash quickly for 6 seconds, and waiting to be excluded, then LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful exclusion.

There are 3 methods for the LED dimmer to quit “exclusion mode”. Once the LED dimmer quits “exclusion mode”, the LED light will stop the fast flash status.

  1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.
  2. Quits after 10 seconds timeout.
  3. Power off and power on the LED dimmer.

(Note: When the LED dimmer already included to a network, triple press “inclusion/exclusion” button, the LED dimmer will be set into exclusion mode and quit exclusion mode alternatively.)

Method 2: Factory reset the LED dimmer will force the LED dimmer to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of the manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### General Usage Information

1.Short press external button on the LED dimmer to switch ON/OFF the connected LED light.

2.Press and hold down external button on the LED dimmer to adjust light intensity of the connected LED light.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9101 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. LED Dimmer Factory Reset, send Command Class "Device Reset Locally Notification V1" to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the LED dimmer.

2. When LED dimmer ON/OFF or light intensity value changes, send Command Class "Basic Report" to associated devices of this group to report ON/OFF or light intensity value information.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
