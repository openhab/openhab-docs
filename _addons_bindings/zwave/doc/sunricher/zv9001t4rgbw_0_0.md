The ZV9001T4-RGBW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

SR-ZV9001T4-RGBW-EU is a touch panel Z-Wave Plus certified wall controller for RGBW LED lighting. As a z-wave secondary controller, it can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network.

It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the groups association to devices support maximum 5 Z-wave devices per group. 20 built-in color changing effects are available with changing speed adjustable.

It is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with RGBW z wave device SR-ZV9103FA-RGBW and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.

### Inclusion Information

Inclusion:

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2. Make sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of this manual).
  3. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion. Once the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off.

There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful inclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

**Method 1: Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:**

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off.

There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

**Method 2: Factory reset** the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. Please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of the manual.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9001T4-RGBW -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9001T4-RGBW supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  1. Send “Command Class Device Reset Locally” to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the wall controller.
  2. Double click a group number of the wall controller to send command to associated devices of this group using “Command Class Central Scene”.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
