The ZV9002T4-CCT supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

SR-ZV9002T4-CCT-EU is a touch control Z-Wave Plus certified wall controller for dual color LED Lighting. As a z-wave secondary controller,  
it is a z wave light switch which can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers  
or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to  
primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group.

It is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with dual color z wave device SR-ZV9102FA-CCT and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions.

The controller is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.

### Inclusion Information

Inclusion (Add the device to a Z-Wave network):

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).
  2. Make sure the wall controller does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the wall controller included to a network” of this manual).
  3. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, then LED indicator turns on and blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “inclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “inclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful inclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion (Remove the device from a Z-Wave network) There are two exclusion methods:

**Method 1:** Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

  1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).
  2. Short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, or press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, the wall controller will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then LED indicator turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful exclusion.

Once the wall controller quits “exclusion mode”, the LED indicator will turns off. There are 3 methods for the wall controller to quit “exclusion mode”:

  1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.
  2. Quits after 25 seconds timeout.
  3. Press and hold down “ALL ON/OFF” button for over 3 seconds, or short press the “inclusion/exclusion” button to quit.

**Method 2:** Factory reset the wall controller will force the wall controller to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)Note:

Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

**How to check whether the wall controller already included to a network**  
Operate any button to check if there is indication from the LED indicator, and no LED indication means the wall controller does not belong to any network. If the wall controller already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network. Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail.

**Factory Reset**  
Press and hold down “inclusion/exclusion” button for over 8 seconds, LED indicator will blink slowly to indicate successful factory reset, release “inclusion/exclusion” button, the wall controller will restart automatically. If this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9002T4-CCT -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9002T4-CCT supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  1. Send “Command Class Device Reset Locally” to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the wall controller.
  2. Double click a group number of the wall controller to send command to associated devices of this group using “Command Class Central Scene”.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Launch 1

  1. Press and hold down button "1" to activate group in order to switch the associated devices with a Basic Set or dim these devices by using the two brightness buttons or adjust color temperature by using color wheel.
  2. Short press Scene button S1/S2/S3/S4, direct control of associated devices using Scene Activation Set, Scene ID = 0x10 / 0x20 / 0x30 / 0x40.
  3. Press and hold down Scene button S1/S2/S3/S4, direct control of associated devices using Scene Conf Set, Scene ID = 0x10 / 0x20 / 0x30 / 0x40.

Association group 2 supports 12 nodes.

### Group 3: Launch 2

  1. Press and hold down button "2" to activate group in order to switch the associated devices with a Basic Set or dim these devices by using the two brightness buttons or adjust color temperature by using color wheel.
