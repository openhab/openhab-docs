The ZV9001T4-DIM supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

SR-ZV9001T4-DIM-EU is a touch control z-wave secondary controller (z wave dimmer switch) with z-wave Plus enabled for single color LED lighting. As a z-wave secondary controller, it is a z wave dimmer switch which can be added to z-wave network and removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) controllers or gateway and control z-wave devices that are added to the network. It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the group association to devices supports maximum 12 Z-wave devices per group. It is a universal z-wave slave which can be compatible with universal z-wave primary controller or gateway. The wireless controller is compatible with single color z wave device SR-ZV9101FA-DIM and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. The controller supports group and scene storage and recall functions. It is easy to install on the wall and available in standard EU size.

### Inclusion Information

Set z-wave master (primary) controller into network inclusion mode (please refer to their manual to learn how) Click the “Inclusion/Exclusion” key on the back of the slave controller (or press and hold down the switch key ) -> LED indicator on the salve controller turns on and flashes 6 times quickly to indicate successful adding -> there shall be an indication on master controller or z-wave gateway

### Exclusion Information

When the slave controller has already been added to z-wave network, set the z-wave master controller or z-wave gateway into network exclusion mode (please refer to their user manual to learn how)

Click the “Inclusion/Exclusion” key on the back of the slave controller (or press and hold down the switch key )

-> LED indicator on the slave controller turns on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful removing

-> there shall be an indication on the master controller

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9001T4-DIM -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer group 1 | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene activation number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Dimmer Group 2 | switch_dimmer1 | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Dimmer group 3 | switch_dimmer2 | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Dimmer Group 4 | switch_dimmer3 | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer group 1

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene activation number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Dimmer Group 2

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer1``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Dimmer group 3

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer2``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Dimmer Group 4

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ZV9001T4-DIM.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Scene_type | Scene type |
| 4 | Scene_send_to_where | Scene send to where |

### Parameter 3: Scene_type

Scene type
Parameter 3 can be configured via “COMMAND\_CLASS\_CONFIGURATION” to decide which scene command to use “CENTRAL SCENE” or “SCENE ACTIVATION”, factory default is “CENTRAL SCENE”.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Scene_send_to_where

Scene send to where
Parameter 4 can be configured via “COMMAND\_CLASS\_CONFIGURATION” to decide which object shall the remote send scene packet to, the gateway or the association group. Factory default is the association group. By factory default this remote uses “CENTRAL SCENE” to send packet to the association group devices, this method requires that the controlled devices support “CENTRAL SCENE”
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9001T4-DIM supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Launch 1
This group supports 12 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Launch 2
This group supports 12 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Launch 3
This group supports 12 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5

Launch 4
This group supports 12 nodes.
