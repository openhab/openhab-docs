The ZV9001K8-DIM supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZV9001K8-DIM does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SR-ZV9001K8-DIM is a new single color wall mounted push button z-wave secondary controller light switch which adopts latest z-wave RF Plus and Mesh network technology to switch and dim single color LED lighting. It is a universal z-wave slave and can be added to z-wave network or removed from z-wave network by z-wave primary (master) or gateway. The wall controller is powered by a cell lithium battery. The wireless dimmer is compatible with single color z wave device SR-ZV9101FA-DIM and different frequencies are available for different countries or areas. The signal transmit distance can be up to 30m. It supports 5 groups for associations, a lifeline group association to primary (master) controller and 4 groups association to devices, the groups association to devices support maximum 20 Z-wave devices per group. Compatible with existing frames from Berker, Gira, Jung and Merten, the z-wave secondary controller is easy to be mounted on the wall.

- Supports 4 groups association to z-wave devices, maximum 20 devices per group

### Inclusion Information

Please make sure the battery of the wall mounted controller has enough power (press any key and if the blue LED  
indicator turns on, which means the remote works well) -> set the master controller or gateway into network inclusion or  
add device mode (please refer to the user manual to learn how) -> press and hold down both keys I and O at the top row  
(group 2) simultaneously on the wall controller until LED indicator turns on and flashes 6 times quickly to indicate  
successful adding -> there shall be an indication on the master controller or gateway.

### Exclusion Information

When the wall mounted controller has already been added to z-wave network, set z-wave master (primary) controller or  
z-wave gateway into network inclusion or remove device mode (please refer to the user manual to learn how) -> press  
and hold down both keys I and O at the top row (group 2) simultaneously on the wall controller until LED indicator turns  
on and shows 3 short blinks and 1 long blink to indicate successful removing -> there shall be an indication on the  
master controller or gateway.

### Wakeup Information

The ZV9001K8-DIM does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZV9001K8-DIM -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| switch_binary2 | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |
| switch_binary | switch_binary1 | Switch | Switch | 
| switch_binary | switch_binary2 | Switch | Switch | 
| switch_binary | switch_binary3 | Switch | Switch | 

### switch_binary

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### switch_binary2

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### switch_dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### switch_binary

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary1``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

The ```switch_binary2``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### switch_binary

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary3``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters configured.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZV9001K8-DIM supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Launch 1


This group supports 20 nodes.

### Group 3: Launch 2


This group supports 20 nodes.

### Group 4: Launch 3


This group supports 20 nodes.

### Group 5: Launch 4


This group supports 20 nodes.
