The ZME_05433 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Z-Wave.Me Dimmer Flush Mountable is a wireless actuator able to dim lights up to 300 W. The device is delivered as complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series Everlux in color white from RE / Duewi. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the dimmer is indicated on a dual color LED for test purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. For dimming the devices apply leading edge phase cutting with a special alignment algorithm for inductive loads. It is therefore possible to dim incandescent lamps, high voltage halogen lights and low voltage halogen lights with traditional transformer. Low voltage halogen lights with switching power supply, LEDs and CFLs must not be attached. The function of the local paddle can be configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control, different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 2 wire system. There is no need for a neutral wire in the wall box.

### Inclusion Information

Triple click on A e of the buttons on the device will include the device. 

### Exclusion Information

 The device is excluded by triple click to one of the buttons.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the ZME_05433.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | LED mode | Set LED indication mode |
| 2 | Automatically switch off after | If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time |
| 3 | What to do on RF off command | Defines how to interpret RF Off command. |
| 4 | Ignore start level | ignore start level in StartLevelChange |
| 5 | Dimming speed | Time to dim on button presses |
| 6 | Dimming long speed | Time to dim on button holds and StartLevelChange |
| 7 | Set maximum light level on On click | set action on ON command |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: LED mode

Set LED indication mode
Set LED indication mode
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Show switch state |
| 2 | Night mode (inverted switch state) |
| 3 | Operated by Indicator Command Class (Default) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (Operated by Indicator Command Class (Default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Automatically switch off after

If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time
Automatically switch off after: 0 Disabled (Default); 1 — 65535 sec
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled (Default) |
| 1 | Sec |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disabled (Default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: What to do on RF off command

Defines how to interpret RF Off command.
Defines how to interpret RF Off command. Can be used in conjunction with Auto Off function: Ignore - to switch on the light by motion detectors and switch it off after some amount of time: in case of multiple motion detectors each would try to switch the light off that would break logics; Switch on - to switch on the light on both On and Off paddle press on the remote and switch it off after some amount of time. Button off click will still work (if button operations are not disabled).
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch off (Default) |
| 1 | Ignore |
| 2 | Switch on |

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes (Default) |
