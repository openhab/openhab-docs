Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | LED mode | Set LED indication mode |
| 2 | Automatically switch off after | If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time |
| 3 | What to do on RF off command | Defines how to interpret RF Off command. |
| 4 | Ignore start level | ignore start level in StartLevelChange |
| 5 | Dimming speed | Time to dim on button presses |
| 6 | Dimming long speed | Time to dim on button holds and StartLevelChange |
| 7 | Set maximum light level on On click | set action on ON command |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: LED mode

Set LED indication mode
Set LED indication mode
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Show switch state |
