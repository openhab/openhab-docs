# ZME\_06443 Single Paddle Wall Controller
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZME_06443*, manufactured by *Z-Wave.Me* with the thing type UID of ```zwaveme_zme06443_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZME_06443 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The ZME_06443 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZME_06443 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the ZME_06443.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

Defines which command should be sent on button double press or press-hold.

Basic and Scene commands are sent to Association group.

Switch All commands are sent broadcast.

If not disabled, the device will wait for a click timeout to see if the second click
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Switch On, Off and dim using Basic Set |
| 2 | Switch All |
| 3 | Scenes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Switch On, Off and dim using Basic Set).

### Parameter 15: Send the following Switch All commands



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Switch OFF Only |
| 2 | Switch ON Only |
| 255 | Switch all on and off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 20: Send unsolicited Battery Report on Wake Up



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | To same node as wake up notification |
| 2 | Broadcast to neighbours |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_20_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZME_06443 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Single Press


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Double Press


This group supports 10 nodes.
