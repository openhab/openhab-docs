The FT121 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The LED Strip is a multi-colored LED Strip which allows control of color temperature (warm/cold white), RGB, and dimming via Z-Wave commands.

### Inclusion Information

Set your Z-Wave controller into pairing mode. Press the Action Button located on the back of the LED Strip's white controller box once (The network LED will blink green as an indication it is pairing insecurely, please refer to section "Enabling Security Encryption" in the Advanced Function section of the manual to pair it securely). If the LED Strip has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its Network LED will become solid. If the pairing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain a colorful gradient, repeat the instructions above from step 1.

### Exclusion Information

Set your Z-Wave controller into device removal mode. Press the Action Button located on the back of the LED Strip's white controller box once. If the LED Strip has been successfully removed from your Z-Wave network, its Network LED will remain colorful gradient. If the removal was unsuccessful, the Network LED will still be solid, repeat the instructions above from step 1.
