The FT098 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FT098 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

Oomi Bulb is a Z-Wave LED module which allows control (on/off/dim) with the use of Z-Wave. It's a bulb which has a Smart RGB LED, which can be used to add colour to your home. The bulb has 5 main colour channels available for you to adjust: Red, Green, Blue, Warm White and Cold White. You can configure its colour according to your favour. The Bulb is also a security Z-wave device and supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.

### Inclusion Information

1. Toggle off the wall switch before you screw in Bulb and firmly screw in Bulb.
2. Set your Z-Wave hub into pairing mode.
3. Toggle off the wall switch controlling your Bulb to turn it off (keep it in the "OFF" state for 2 seconds) and then toggle on the wall switch to turn your Bulb on, the green will blink to indicate the Bulb is entering into pairing mode.
4. If Bulb has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid when you turn Bulb on.

Note:

1. If your Bulb has already been added into another Z-Wave network, you'll need to remove it from the existing network first. Refer to the Exclusion instructions.
2. To check if LED Bulb is already paired to an existing network, toggle the wall switch off and on 3 times fast (the final ending position of the wall switch must be on). If LED Bulb blinks orange for 3 seconds, it is already paired into a Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

Your Bulb can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller. To set your Z-Wave hub into removal mode, please refer to the respective section within your hubs instruction manual.

1. Set your Z-Wave hub into device removal mode.
2. Toggle the wall switch off and on 3 times fast (the final ending position of the wall switch must be on). If successful, the Bulb will change to orange colour for 2 seconds before changing to white. If removal was unsuccessful, then Bulb will blink orange for 3 seconds before changing to red colour for 2 seconds.

### Wakeup Information

To check if LED Bulb is already paired to an existing network, toggle the wall switch off and on 3 times fast (the final ending position of the wall switch must be on). If LED Bulb blinks orange for 3 seconds, it is already paired into a Z-Wave network.
