The ZW37 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The 2 ports smart plug provides one Z-Wave outlet for remote controlled by controller through Z-Wave gateway for internet of thing service and can be configured in Z-Wave sensor network, if Z-Wave certified controller features remote access, you can now control your device from your mobile phone devices. the other outlet will be manual On/Off by push button on front. The outlets have maximum load for 600W Incandescent, ½ HP motor or 1200W resistive

### Inclusion Information

  1. Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave certified controller to include the device to the Z-Wave network.
  2. Once the controller is ready to include your device, single press and release the toggle (A) 3-5 times within 3 seconds on the device to include it in the network. * Devices with AUTO Inclusion - After setting the HUB controller to Inclusion/Pairing mode, simply plug in the device and the device will automatically begin the inclusion process.
  3. Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been included and placed at its desired location, refresh the Z-Wave network to optimize performance.
  4. The association group supports two nodes and life line function. Note: Your device may need to be within 10 feet of the controller to be included. If so, include the device to the network within 10 feet of the controller and relocate it to the desired position in your home. Be sure to refresh the network if the device is included in this manner.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Follow the instructions for your Z-Wave certified controller to exclude a device from the Z-Wave network.
  2. Once the controller is ready to exclude your device, press in and release the toggle (A) 3-5 times within 3 seconds to exclude it from the network.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW37 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Switch 1 | switch_binary1 | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Switch 2 | switch_binary2 | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 1
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary1``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 2

The ```switch_binary2``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW37 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
