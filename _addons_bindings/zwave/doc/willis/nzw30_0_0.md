The NZW30 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Inovelli's In-Wall Smart Switch (On/Off) not only has the ability to turn on and off appliances, lights, and more from anywhere in the world, but it acts as a Z-Wave signal repeater, which amplifies your Z-Wave signal, growing the capabilities of your network.  
  
In addition, it has scene control enabled, which allows you to double tap the switch to activate a Z-Wave scene. An example would be a bedtime scene, which turns off all lights, locks the door(s) and sets the temperature to 68 degrees.

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NZW30 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
An association command class that allows the device to communicate with other Z-Wave devices directly -- such as sending BASIC REPORT whenever the switch is turned on or off.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
