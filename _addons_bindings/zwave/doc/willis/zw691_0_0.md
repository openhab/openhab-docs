The ZW691 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This ZW691 Duplex Receptacle is designed to work with other Z-WAVE enabled devices. Z-WAVE nodes of other types can be Included in the system and will also act as repeaters.This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller. The top outlet is active and the bottom is controlled through Z-wave or through the manual button on the outlet as is typical for a Z-wave outle

### Exclusion Information

Press the learn switch of ZW691 three times for 1 second at least & release to be excluded

### Wakeup Information

The ZW691 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW691 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)
Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel is of type ```meter_voltage``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)
Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel is of type ```meter_current``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kVAh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kVAh).

The ```meter_kvah``` channel is of type ```meter_kvah``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
