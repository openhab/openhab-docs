### Inclusion Information

1\. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible

2\. Put your Z-Wave controller in inclusion mode

3\. Tap the switch on and off quickly 3 times to finalize the inclusion process

4\. A new on/off device should appear on your controller's device list

Troubleshooting Tips:

If you are unable to include the Z-Wave switch to your controller, please try one of the following:

\- Bring the controller closer to your Z-Wave switch or use a hand-held secondary controller for inclusion

\- Tap your Z-Wave switch quicker 4 or 5 times once you put the controller in the inclusion mode to ensure the command has gone through

\- Put your controller in the EXCLUSION mode and tap the switch quickly 3 times, then try adding it to your network again

### Exclusion Information

1\. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible

2\. Put your Z-Wave controller in exclusion mode

3\. Tap the switch on and off quickly 3 times to complete the exclusion process

4\. The device should disappear from your controller's device list

Please repeat the process following all steps carefully if the first attempt is unsuccessful

### Wakeup Information

The switch will be reset to factory defaults only by exclusion using a Z-Wave controller. You may use any certified Z-Wave controller to exclude and reset the switch. This device may not be reset manually when the network’s primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. NOTE: All previously recorded activity and custom settings will be erased from the device’s memory.
