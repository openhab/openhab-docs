## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NZW39 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Sends on/off commands to associated devices when switch is pressed (BASIC_SET)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Sends dim/brighten commands to associated devices when switch is pressed (SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_SET)

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
