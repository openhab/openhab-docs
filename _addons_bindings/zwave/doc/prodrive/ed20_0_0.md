# ED2.0 Eneco Meter Adapter
This describes the Z-Wave device *ED2.0*, manufactured by *[Prodrive Technologies](http://prodrive-technologies.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```prodrive_ed20_00_000```.

The ED2.0 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The meter adapter measures gas and electricity usage of analog and digital meters. Analog meters are read by means of optical sensors that can be placed on the meter to monitor the rotating disc or the blinking LED. In case of a digital meter, the meter adapter can be connected to the digital meter by means of a P1 digital communication interface. The meter adapter measures the cumulative and instantaneous gas and electricity consumption and sends this information to a Z-Wave enabled display (ED2.0 Display).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_0_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 1: Gas Meter resolution

The resolution of the analog gas meter
The resolution of the analog gas meter (revolutions per mÂ³) in unsigned Q14.2 notation.
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```400```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Electricity metering

Enable and disable Electricity metering

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```400```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
