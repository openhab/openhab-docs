The ED2.0 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The meter adapter measures gas and electricity usage of analog and digital meters. Analog meters are read by means of optical sensors that can be placed on the meter to monitor the rotating disc or the blinking LED. In case of a digital meter, the meter adapter can be connected to the digital meter by means of a P1 digital communication interface. The meter adapter measures the cumulative and instantaneous gas and electricity consumption and sends this information to a Z-Wave enabled display (ED2.0 Display).

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the ED2.0.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Analog gas/heat port mode | Analog gas/heat port mode |
| 2 | Analog gas/heat port resolution | Analog gas/heat port resolution |
| 3 | Analog electricity port mode | Analog electricity port mode |
| 4 | Analog electricity port resolution | Analog electricity port resolution |
| 255 | Restart device | Restart device or metering chip |

### Parameter 1: Analog gas/heat port mode

Analog gas/heat port mode

The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 2 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Gas enabled |
| 2 | Heat enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Gas enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Analog gas/heat port resolution

Analog gas/heat port resolution
pulses per cubic meter / pulses per MJ; in Q14.2 notation
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```400```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Analog electricity port mode

Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```400```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 255: Restart device

Restart device or metering chip

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Restart entire device |
| 2 | Restart metering chip |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ED2.0 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
