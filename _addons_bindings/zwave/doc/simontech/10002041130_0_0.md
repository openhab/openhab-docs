## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10002041-130 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 (Lifeline)
**COMMAND\_CLASS\_BASIC_REPORT**

It is sent to the associated nodes when the load changes state:

  * ON -> 0xFF
  * OFF -> 0x00

**COMMAND\_CLASS\_METER\_REPORT\_V4**

It is sent to the associated nodes when the power consumed varies more than 10%

Electric meter, Consumed, Watts, Size 4, Precision 1, Value (W)

**COMMAND\_CLASS\_DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_ NOTIFICATION**

The associated nodes are sent when the device is deleted from the Z-Wave network

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: ctrl

Group 2 (Control)
COMMAND\_CLASS\_BASIC_REPORT

It is sent to the associated nodes when the load changes state:

  * ON -> 0xFF
  * OFF -> 0x00

Association group 2 supports 20 nodes.
