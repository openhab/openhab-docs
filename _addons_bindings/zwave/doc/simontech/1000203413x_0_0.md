The 10002080-13x supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Roller Blind IO is ready to operate with Z-Wave controllers and configured to be managed by Simon100 IO APP using the HUB plug IO for getting a better user experience. Sending the Blind Up/Down or setting a specific position.

### Inclusion Information

When the pushbutton is released after a press of (2<T<10sec) the device will send a NIF to include from Z-Wave network or perform an association with other Z-Wave device.

Central LED will Blink with 0,3 sec period to inform that NIF can be send after release of pushbutton.

This process does not perform a default reset of configurations.

Main LED will Blink with 0,3 sec period to inform that NIF can be send after release of pushbutton.

### Exclusion Information

When the pushbutton is released after a press of (2<T<10sec) the device will send a NIF to exclude from Z-Wave network or perform an association with other Z-Wave device.

Main LED will Blink with 0,3 sec period to inform that NIF can be send after release of pushbutton.

This process does not perform a default reset of configurations.

Main LED will Blink with 0,3 sec period to inform that NIF can be send after release of pushbutton.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 10002080-13x supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
Change on Sunblind position:

  * On -> CC Basic, Basic Report.
  * Value 0x01 - 0x63 Report sunblind position

Calibration requirement change. (If device needs to be calibrated and is Added into a ZWave network, it will report after receive an Association Set of life line).

  * Calibration required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0xF
  * Calibration not required -> CC Configuration, Configuration Report, Param 23, Value 0x00

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: ctrl

Control
Change on Sunblind position:

  * CC Basic, Basic Report.
  * Value 0x00 - 0x63 Report sunblind position

Association group 2 supports 20 nodes.
