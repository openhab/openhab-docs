The AB02Z_PSE02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Zipato indoor siren is an intelligent device that can be controlled remotely by Z-wave network. The indoor siren is battery powered, small and easily installed. When the siren is triggered, LED light will flash, and there will be an alarm sound at the same time. The sound level is at least 115 dB.

### Inclusion Information

The indoor siren can be included to the Z-Wave network by pressing the code button.

  1. Disassemble the siren and insert the battery into the siren. Make sure the device is located withinthe direct range of the controller.
  2. Set the controller into the inclusion mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
  3. Quickly triple click the code button, LED light will flash red for 5 times.
  4. The Indoor siren will be detected and includedin the Z-Wave network.
  5. Wait for the main controller to configure the siren.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Make sure the siren is connected to power source. 2) Set the main controller into the exclusion mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
  2. Quickly triple click the code button, LED light will flash red for 5 times
  3. Wait for the main controller to remove the sensor. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the AB02Z_PSE02 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AB02Z_PSE02 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline, reports relay’s status to just one device, Z-wave network’s main controller by default. It’s not recommended to modify settings of this association group.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Siren status

is assigned to the siren status - ON/OFF. Allows for sending a controlled command to the associated device whenever the Indoor siren is turned ON (or OFF).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
