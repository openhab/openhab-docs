# NE-NAS-PD01Z PIR motion sensor and light measurement
This describes the Z-Wave device *NE-NAS-PD01Z*, manufactured by *[Zipato](http://www.zipato.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```zipato_nenaspd01z_00_000```.

The NE-NAS-PD01Z supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The NE-NAS-PD01Z does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The NE-NAS-PD01Z does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the NE-NAS-PD01Z -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | Temperature | Number | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (luminance)

Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (burglar)

Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Parameter 1: Sensitivity level

8 = Highest sensitivity, 255 = lowest sesitivity
1\. SENSITIVITY LEVEL SETTING

This parameter defines the sensitivity of PIR sensor. It’s recommended to test the sensor with moevements from a farthest end of the coverage area at the first time of use. If movements cannot be detected sensitively, simply adjust the sensitivity level with this parameter. This parameter can be configured with the value of 8 through 255, where 8 means high sensitivity and 255 means low sensitivity. Function: Sensivity Level Setting

Parameter size: 1 byte

Parameter number: 1

Available settings: 8 ~ 255

Default settings: 12
Values in the range 8 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```12```.

### Parameter 2: ON / OFF Duration

How long should the associated devices have ON status.
2\. ON / OFF DURATION

This parameter determines how long the associated devices should have ON status. For instace, if this parameter is set to 30 (sec), the PIR sensor will send a BASIC\_SET command to associated device with valu BASIC\_SET level if PIR sensor is triggered and associated device will be turned on 30 seconds begore it’s turned off. This parameter value must be large as Parameter #. If user set this parameter to default by Configure CC, the parameter # will be set to default value.

Function: ON / OFF duration setting

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: BASIC SET Level

BASIC SET LEVEL

If user sets this parameter to default by Configure CC, the parameter #2 will be set to default value.

Function: Re-trigger interval setting

Parameter size: 1 byte

Parameter number: 6

### Parameter 8: LUX level function enable

See overview
8\. LUX LEVEL FUNCTION ENABLE If this parameter is set to “1” and when Lux level is less than the value defined by parameter #5, PIR sensor will send a BASIC\_SET command frame (i.e. BASIC\_SET (value = parameter 3) to an associated device and activate it. If Lux level is greater than the value defined by parameter #5, PIR sensor will not send BASIC\_SET command frame.

Function: Lux Level Enable

Parameter size: 1 byte

Available settings: 0~1000 (Lux)

Default setting: 1
Values in the range 0 to 1000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NE-NAS-PD01Z supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

lifeline service
This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

BASIC\_SET control command group
This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

NOTIFICATION\_REPORT\_V4
This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4
