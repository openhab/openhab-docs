## Overview

The Z-Wave Plus Extender incorporates third party Z-Wave devices into WeR@Home™, integrating home automation and control functions with the core WeR@Home™ system.

Features include:

  * Single-element, compact Z-Wave Plus controller
  * Allows Z-Wave devices to be added as seamlessly integrated elements in WeR@Home™.
  * Enables support for Smart Devices such as: 
      * Light switches (on/off and dimmer)

### Inclusion Information

If you have an existing third-party Z-Wave network, WeR@Home™ can join the network. WeR@Home™ enters "learn" mode on the existing network to automatically copy the existing network's Smart Home network structure. When you join a Z-Wave network, you have access to the Z-Wave devices supported by WeR@Home™. The Z-Wave Plus Extender is assigned one of the following roles depending on the third-party controller capabilities:

  * **Secondary (inclusion)** - allowed to add or delete additional Z-Wave devices
  * **Secondary** –not allowed to add or delete additional Z-Wave devices

To join an existing third-party Z-Wave network:

  1. Remove all Z-Wave devices from your WeR@Home™, except for your Z-Wave Plus Extender. Refer to 5.5 Removing a Z-Wave Device on page 14.
  2. In the WeR@Home™ app, tap "menu" The main menu appears.
  3. Tap "Devices". The Devicesscreen appears.
  4. Tap the gear icon for your Z-Wave Plus Extender. The Z-Wave Controller configuration screen appears.
  5. Put the primary controller of the existing network into Add mode, according to the controller’s user manual.
  6. Tap Join Existing Network. All Z-Wave devices are removed from WeR@Home™. WeR@Home™ copies the topology of the existing network and prompts you to enter the name for the existing network controller.
  7. Enter the name for the existing network controller and tap OK.

The following table summarises the channels available for the ES800ZWE -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ES800ZWE supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.
