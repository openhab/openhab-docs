Smart Hidden Door Lock restores factory default automatically when the device is excluded. Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Ensure the SHDL is powered and the battery is fully charged.
  2. Set the main controller into the Add device mode (see a main controller’s operating manual).
  3. Triple click Z-Wave button on the Z-Wave module(inside lock body) within 1.5 seconds, the LED will flicker rapidly while inclusion process implement and light on 2 second after processing complete.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Ensure the SHDL is powered and the battery is fully charged.
  2. Set the main controller into the Remove device mode (see a main controller’s operating manual).
  3. Triple click Z-Wave button on the Z-Wave module(inside lock body) within 1.5 seconds, the LED will flicker rapidly while exclusion process implement and light on 2 second after processing complete.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the BSL01 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Lock | lock_door | lock_door | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door Lock
Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel is of type ```lock_door``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Locked |
| OFF | Unlocked |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The BSL01 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Association Group 2 is assigned to sending the Basic Set Off frame to associated device (e.g. another SHDL) while the SHDL is unlocked and sending the Basic Set On frame to associated device while the SHDL is locked with security transport if SHDL was added to network as security node or with non-security transport if SHDL was added to network as non-security node

Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Group 3

Association Group 3 is assigned to sending the Basic Set On frame to associated devices with non-security transport while the SHDL is unlocked. 

Association group 3 supports 1 node.

### Group 4: Group 4

Association Group 3 is assigned to sending the Basic Set On frame to associated devices with non-security transport while the SHDL is unlocked. 

Association group 4 supports 1 node.
