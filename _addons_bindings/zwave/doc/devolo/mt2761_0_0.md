The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the MT2761.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 40 | Power reporting in Watts | Power reporting in Watts on power change for Q1 or Q2 |
| 71 | Operating modes | This parameter defines selection between two available operating modes |
| 72 | Slats tilting full turn time | This parameter defines the time necessary for slats to make full turn (180 degrees) |
| 73 | Slats position | Slats return to previously set position only in case of Z-wave control (not valid for limit switch positions) |
| 78 | Forced Shutter calibration | By modifying the parameters setting from 0 to 1 a Shutter enters the calibration mode. |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 40: Power reporting in Watts

Power reporting in Watts on power change for Q1 or Q2

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_40_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 71: Operating modes

This parameter defines selection between two available operating modes
This parameter defines selection between two available operating modes. NOTE1: After parameter change, first exclude module (without setting parameters to default value) then wait at least 30s and then re include the module!
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_71_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 72: Slats tilting full turn time

This parameter defines the time necessary for slats to make full turn (180 degrees)
This parameter defines the time necessary for slats to make full turn (180 degrees)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Tilting time disabled |
| 2 | = 0,01seconds - 327,67 seconds |
| 150 | = 1,5 seconds |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```150``` (= 1,5 seconds).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_72_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 73: Slats position

Slats return to previously set position only in case of Z-wave control (not valid for limit switch positions)
This parameter defines slats position after up/down movement through Z-wave or push-buttons.

• default value 1 

• 0 - Slats return to previously set position only in case of Z-wave control (not valid for limit switch positions).

• 1 - Slats return to previously set position in case of Z-wave control, push-button operation or when the lower limit switch is reached.
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_73_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 78: Forced Shutter calibration

By modifying the parameters setting from 0 to 1 a Shutter enters the calibration mode.
Set to 1 - Start calibration process (when calibration process is finished, completing full cycle - up, down and up, set the parameter 78 (Forced Shutter calibration) value back to 0
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_78_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MT2761 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
