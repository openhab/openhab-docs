The PSC132ZW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The wireless flush-mount switching actuator PSC132ZW allows you to remotely control electrical appliances. It features a metering function to measure the power consumption and the accumulated energy usage of connected equipment. The built-in metering unit is of high quality: it calculates the true-power and also works for small loads from 1W upwards. This feature is important to have a correct measurement value also for electronic loads like led lamps.

The PSC132ZW has a built-in safety features that will switch-off the output in case of too high temperature or overload.

Additionally the PSC132 has a feature to switch the load on at zero voltage and switch the load off at zero current. This leads to a very high number of possible switching cycles also for difficult loads like led-lamps or motors, e.g. pumps.

### Inclusion Information

When a PS132ZW that is not associated to a Z-Wave network is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. The PSC132ZW can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:

1. start inclusion/exclusion on the primary controller
2. hold the touch button until the led shows green light
3. release the touch button

The PSC132ZW will confirm successful addition to the network by 5 green flashes.

### Exclusion Information

When a PS132ZW that is not associated to a Z-Wave network is inserted into the mains outlet, it will flash once red followed by 2 green flashes followed by steady red flashing. The PSC132ZW can now be added to (=inclusion) or removed from (=exclusion) a Z-Wave network:

1. start inclusion/exclusion on the primary controller
2. hold the touch button until the led shows green light
3. release the touch button

The PSC132ZW will confirm successful removal/exclusion by steady red flashing. At the time of exclusion the device is factory reset.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PSC132ZW -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the PSC132ZW.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 31 | Local Control Off | Separates pushbutton and S1 input from relay |

### Parameter 31: Local Control Off

Separates pushbutton and S1 input from relay
If "LocalControlOn" is set (factory default state) the PSC132ZWs output can be switched manually by a mechanical rocker-switch or a pushbutton that is connected to the S1 input of the device. If "LocalControlOff" is set, the PSC132ZWs output can only be switched through Z-Wave telegrams. In both modes the operational state of the mechanical switch is reported to association group 2. LocalControlOff is ment for using the switch-input functionality and the relay functionality separately.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LocalControlOn |
| 1 | LocalControlOff |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LocalControlOn).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1_00000001``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSC132ZW supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Output

Output State and Power Meter
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Input

Reports S1 Input State
This group supports 5 nodes.
