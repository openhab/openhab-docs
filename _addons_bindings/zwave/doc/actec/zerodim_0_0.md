| 2 | Maximum brightness level | Set the desired value from 2 to 99% for the maximum dim level that the dimmer is restricted to; the dimmer will not go higher than the value set here. |
| 3 | Automatic control - dimming step size | This parameter defines the percentage value of dimming step during the automatic control. |
| 4 | Automatic control - time of a dimming step | This parameter defines the time of single dimming step set in parameter 3 during the automatic control. |
| 5 | Manual control - dimming step size | This parameter defines the percentage value of dimming step during the manual control. |
| 6 | Manual control - time of a dimming step | This parameter defines the time of single dimming step setting parameter 5 during the manual control. |
| 7 | State after power failure |  |
| 8 | Scene ID set | Scene ID is set by this configuration. Note: The actual action of each SCENE ID are set by SCENE\_ACTUATOR\_CONF(0x26) command. |
| 9 | Auto-off timer | Auto-off timer in seconds (1s-9.1s). 0 = disabled. |

### Parameter 1: Minimum brightness level

Set the desired value from 1 to 98% for the minimum dim level that the dimmer is restricted to; the dimmer will not go lower than the value set here.

Auto-off timer in seconds (1s-9.1s). 0 = disabled.

Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Zerodim supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
Supports the following command classes:   
- Device Reset Locally: triggered upon reset.    
- Switch Multilevel Report: triggered by local light level change.   
- Notification Report: triggered by Notification.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off(rotary knob)

Mirroring of endpoint 1, group2

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer(rotary knob)

Mirroring of endpoint 1, group3

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
