Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Dimmer1
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer1``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 9 configuration parameters available in the Zerodim 2 phase.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Minimum brightness level | Set the desired value from 1 to 98% for the minimum dim level that the dimmer is restricted to; the dimmer will not go lower than the value set here. |
| 2 | Maximum brightness level | Set the desired value from 2 to 99% for the maximum dim level that the dimmer is restricted to; the dimmer will not go higher than the value set here. |
| 3 | Automatic control - dimming step size | This parameter defines the percentage value of dimming step during the automatic control. |
| 4 | Automatic control - time of a dimming step | This parameter defines the time of single dimming step set in parameter 3 during the automatic control. |
| 5 | Manual control - dimming step size | This parameter defines the percentage value of dimming step during the manual control. |
| 6 | Manual control - time of a dimming step | This parameter defines the time of single dimming step setting parameter 5 during the manual control. |
| 7 | State after power failure | Restore state after power failure |
| 8 | Scene ID set | Scene ID is set by this configuration. Note: The actual action of each SCENE ID are set by SCENE\_ACTUATOR\_CONF(0x26) command. |
| 9 | Auto-off timer | Auto-off timer in seconds (1s-9.1h). 0 = disabled. |

### Parameter 1: Minimum brightness level

Set the desired value from 1 to 98% for the minimum dim level that the dimmer is restricted to; the dimmer will not go lower than the value set here.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
