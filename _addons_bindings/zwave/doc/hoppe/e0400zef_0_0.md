The E0400Z-EF does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The eHandle ConnectSense for windows is a smart home component intended to transmit the position of the window and the handle (closed (0°), open (90°) or tilted (180°). When closed, the eHandle Connect Sense for windows is also able to detect common burglary attempts like drilling or prying a window open. In addition, the state of the battery is transmitted to the smart home central control unit. This product can be operated in any Z-Wave™ network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers. All mains operated devices within the network can act as repeaters regardless of manufacturer to increase reliability and range of the network.

### Wakeup Information

The E0400Z-EF does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To save energy and increase battery life, the eHandle ConnectSense for windows is in sleep mode as a standard. In this mode, it does not actively receive any wireless signals. Therefore, operation is only possible with a mains-powered smart home central control unit. It saves the wireless signals for the eHandle ConnectSense for windows until the next wake-up.

### General Usage Information

The eHandle ConnectSense communicates via the Z-Wave™ protocol. The following information is sent to the Smart Home central control unit: • Window handle positions - Closed - Opened - Tilted and additionally • Window positions - Closed - Opened • Burglary attempt (with window closed only) • Battery status

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the E0400Z-EF.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | BASIC command value sent to Association Groups o | Defines the BASIC command value sent in case of ON event |
| 2 | BASIC command value sent to Association Groups o | Defines the BASIC command value sent in case of OFF event |
| 3 | Report Last State on Wakeup | Activate/Deactivate handle/window reporting on wakeup |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: BASIC command value sent to Association Groups o

Defines the BASIC command value sent in case of ON event

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 255 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255``` (ON).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: BASIC command value sent to Association Groups o

Defines the BASIC command value sent in case of OFF event

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 255 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Report Last State on Wakeup

Activate/Deactivate handle/window reporting on wakeup

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 255 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255``` (ON).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The E0400Z-EF supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline for Reporting
0x0001

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: WINDOW_TILTING
