The CH-601 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The electric crane CH-601 is a Z-Wave device that is used for remote or manual opening / closing of water supply in water supply and heating systems. CH-601 is an electromechanical design that consists of an electric drive and a two-way ball valve of the open / closed type.   The crane can be used together with a flood sensor to create a universal device that automatically closes the water supply in case of a leak.   The crane is equipped with manual control, which makes it possible to open and close the valve 

### Inclusion Information

To turn the module on in the Z-Wave network, place the controller in the learning mode (see the instructions of your controller) and turn on the tap in the electrical network. The device will be added automatically (NWI). In case this did not happen automatically, you need to open the top cover of the device and once click the add / remove button from the Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

To exclude (delete) a module from the Z-Wave network, unscrew the 5 bolts on the top panel of the device and remove the cover. Switch the controller to the exclusion mode (see the controller instruction) and once click the add / remove button from the Z-Wave network.

Please note, after excluding the device from the Z-Wave network, all settings you have made will be reset to the factory settings.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the CH-601 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the CH-601.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Operating Mode | Selecting the operating mode |
| 2 | Auto Disabling With Delay | After opening, the tap will automatically close after a certain time. |

### Parameter 1: Operating Mode

Selecting the operating mode
Parameter value = 0 (OPERATE normally) - close the electric valve when you turn OFF (displayed OFF), when the open (displayed ON)

Parameter value = 1 (OPERATE in reverse mode) - open when turning OPEN the electric valve (displayed OFF), when the close (displayed ON)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Normal mode |
| 1 | Reverse mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Reverse mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Auto Disabling With Delay

After opening, the tap will automatically close after a certain time.
After opening, the valve will automatically close after a certain time. Auto-disable does not work when "0" is selected in the parameter. The units used in the parameter are: 1 - 65000 (1 = 1sec)
Values in the range 0 to 65000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CH-601 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Device Status


Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: Status of valve movement


Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
