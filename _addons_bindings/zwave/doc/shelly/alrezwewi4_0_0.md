The Wave i4 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Device is a 4-digital inputs module (110-240 V AC) that controls other devices within the Z-Wave network.

It enables manual activation or deactivation of scenes through a switch/push-button.

Note that endpoints 2-5 correspond to the module inputs SW1-SW4 !

### Inclusion Information

Adding (inclusion) with the S button

  1. Connect the Device to a power supply.
  2. Check if the blue LED is blinking slowly. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave® network.
  3. Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.
  4. To enter the Setting mode, quickly press and hold the S button on the Device until the LED turns solid blue.
  5. Quickly release and then press and hold (> 2s) the S button on the Device until the blue LED starts blinking slowly. Releasing the S button will start the Learn mode.
  6. The blue LED will be blinking faster during the adding process.
  7. The green LED will be blinking slowly if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave® network.

Adding (inclusion) with a switch/push-button

  1. Connect the Device to a power supply.
  2. Check if the blue LED is blinking slowly. If so, the Device is not added to a -Wave® network.
  3. Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.
  4. Toggle the switch/push-button connected to any of the SW terminals (SW, SW1, SW2, etc.) 3 times within 3 seconds (this procedure puts the Device in Learn mode*). The Device must receive on/off signal 3 times, which means pressing the momentary switch 3 times, or toggling the switch on and off 3 times.
  5. The blue LED will be blinking faster during the adding process.
  6. The green LED will be blinking slowly if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave® network.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Wave i4 supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
“Lifeline Group” reports the status of the Device and allows to assign only one device (gateway by default).
The following command classes are supported:

1. INDICATOR_REPORT : LED status

2. DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION : triggered upon request

3. SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT : status change report on SW1

4. SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT : status change report on SW2

5. SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT : status change report on SW3

6. SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT : status change report on SW4

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses Basic command class).

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW4 terminal (uses Basic command class).
Triggered by SW4. Supports the following command classes:

BASIC_SET : set On / Off state at the associated device

Association group 10 supports 9 nodes.

### Group 11: Group 11

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW4 terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class).
Triggered by SW4. It is recommended to use push buttons for this association. Supports the following command classes:
