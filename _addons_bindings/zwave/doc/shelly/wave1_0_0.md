The Wave 1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Device controls on/off function for one electrical device, e.g., bulb, ceiling fan, IR heater, electrical locks, garage doors, irrigation system, etc. The output contact is potential-free (dry contact), so different power supply loads (up to 16 A) can be connected to the Device. It is compatible with push-buttons and switches (default).

### Inclusion Information

**SmartStart adding (inclusion)**

SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave™ network by scanning the Z-Wave™ QR Code present on the Device with a gateway providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required, and the SmartStart device will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.

With the gateway application scan the QR code on the Device label and add the Security 2 (S2) Device Specific Key (DSK) to the provisioning list in the gateway.

Connect the Device to a power supply.

Check if the blue LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave™ network.

Adding will be initiated automatically within a few seconds after connecting the Device to a power supply, and the Device will be added to a Z-Wave™ network automatically.

The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the adding process.

The green LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave™ network.

  


**Adding (inclusion) with the S button**

Connect the Device to a power supply.

Check if the blue LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave™ network.

Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.

To enter the Setting mode, quickly press and hold the S button on the Device until the LED turns solid blue.

Quickly release and then press and hold (> 2s) the S button on the Device until the blue LED starts blinking in Mode 3. Releasing the S button will start the Learn mode.

The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the adding process.

The green LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave™ network.

_Note! In Setting mode, the Device has a timeout of 10s before entering again into Normal mode._

_  
_ 

**Adding (inclusion) with a switch/push-button**

Connect the Device to a power supply.

Check if the blue LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave™ network.

Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.

Toggle the switch/push-button connected to any of the SW terminals (SW, SW1, SW2, etc.) 3 times within 3 seconds (this procedure puts the Device in Learn mode*). The Device must receive on/off signal 3 times, which means pressing the momentary switch 3 times, or toggling the switch on and off 3 times.

The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the adding process.

The green LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave™ network.

*Learn mode - a state that allows the Device to receive network information from the gateway.

### Exclusion Information

**Removing (exclusion) with the S button**

To enter the Setting mode, quickly press and hold the S button on the Device until the LED turns solid blue.

Quickly release and then press and hold (> 2s) the S button on the Device until the blue LED starts blinking in Mode 3. Releasing the S button will start the LEARN MODE.

The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the removing process.

The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully removed from a Z-Wave™ network.

_Note! In Setting mode, the Device has a timeout of 10s before entering again into Normal mode._

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Wave 1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline Group

Lifeline Group for Controller
**Association group 1**

Lifeline Group reports the Device status and allows for assigning single Device only (Gateway by default), 1 node allowed only. Supports the following command classes:

INDICATOR_REPORT : LED status

DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION : triggered upon request

SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT : status change report for output O (O1)

NOTIFICATION_REPORT : triggered on Overheat

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Switch 1 - Basic On/Off

Switch 1 (SW1) Basic On/Off
**Association Group 2**

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses Basic command class).

Triggered by SW (SW1). The device sends according to the state of SW (SW1) (switch or push-button) the command BASIC\_SET ON or BASIC\_SET OFF to the associated device. This command is reflected to the output of associated device.Supports the following command classes:

BASIC_SET : set On / Off state at the associated device

Association group 2 supports 9 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch 1 - Multilevel

Switch 1 (SW1) Multilevel
**Association Group 3**

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses multilevel start / stop command class).

Triggered by SW (SW1). The device sends according to the state of SW (SW1) (switch or push-button) the command SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE or SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_STOP\_LEVEL\_CHANGE to the associated device. Supports the following command classes:

SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE : initiate a transition to a new level

SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_STOP\_LEVEL\_CHANGE : stop an ongoing transition
