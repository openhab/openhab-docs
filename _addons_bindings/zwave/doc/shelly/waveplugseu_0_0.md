The Device is a smart plug/outlet with power measurement and overheating protection, which allows remote control of electrical appliances through a mobile phone, tablet, PC, or home automation system.

### Inclusion Information

SmartStart adding (inclusion)

SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave® network by scanning the Z-Wave® QR Code present on the Device with a gateway providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required, and the SmartStart device will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.

With the gateway application scan the QR code on the Device label and add the Security 2 (S2) Device Specific Key (DSK) to the provisioning list in the gateway.

Connect the Device to a power supply.

Check if the blue LED is blinking in Mode 1. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave® network.

Adding will be initiated automatically within a few seconds after connecting the Device to a power supply, and the Device will be added to a Z-Wave® network automatically.

The blue LED will be blinking in Mode 2 during the adding process.

The green LED will be blinking in Mode 1 if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave® network.

Adding (inclusion) with the S button (*not available for Long Range inclusion)

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Wave Plug S EU supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline group
"Lifeline group" sends to the controlling device it's command class notifications and or command class reports when said command classes are triggered. Max. 9 nodes are allowed

Association group 1 supports 9 nodes.

### Group 2: O1 - Basic On/Off

It is assigned to output O (O1) (uses Basic command class).
Triggered by O (O1). Supports the following command classes:

BASIC_SET : set On / Off state at the associated device

Association group 2 supports 9 nodes.
