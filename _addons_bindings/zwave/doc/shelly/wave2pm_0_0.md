### Inclusion Information

SmartStart adding (inclusion)

SmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave™ network by scanning the Z-Wave™ QR Code present on the Device with a gateway providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required, and the SmartStart device will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.

  1. With the gateway application scan the QR code on the Device label and add the Security 2 (S2) Device Specific Key (DSK) to the provisioning list in the gateway.
  2. Connect the Device to a power supply.
  3. Check if the blue LED is blinking slowly. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave™ network.
  4. Adding will be initiated automatically within a few seconds after connecting the Device to a power supply, and the Device will be added to a Z-Wave™ network automatically.
  5. The blue LED will be blinking faster during the adding process.
  6. The green LED will be blinking in slowly if the Device is successfully added to a Z-Wave™ network.

Adding (inclusion) with the S button

  1. Connect the Device to a power supply.
  2. Check if the blue LED is blinking slowly. If so, the Device is not added to a Z-Wave™ network.
  3. Enable add/remove mode on the gateway.
  4. To enter the Setting mode, quickly press and hold the S button on the Device until the LED turns solid blue.
  5. Quickly release and then press and hold (> 2s) the S button on the Device until the blue LED starts blinking slowly. Releasing the S button will start the Learn mode.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Wave 2PM supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Association Group 1 - Lifeline

“Lifeline Group” reports the status of the Device status and allows to assign only one device (gateway by default); only 1 node is allowed
Association Group 1 - Lifeline

1. INDICATOR_REPORT : LED status

2. DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION : triggered upon request

3. SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT : status change report for all outputs O (O, O1, O2, …) - common

4. NOTIFICATION_REPORT : triggered on Overheat

5. NOTIFICATION_REPORT : triggered on Over-current detected sum of all outputs O (O1+O2+…)

6. NOTIFICATION_REPORT : triggered on Over-voltage detected

7. NOTIFICATION_REPORT : triggered on AC mains disconnected

8. METER_REPORT : triggered by the load power consumption of all connected loads to all outputs O (O1+O2+…) (according to the settings of Parameters from No. 36 to 43)

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.

### Group 2: Association Group 2

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses Basic command class). Triggered by SW (SW1).
The device sends according to the state of SW (SW1) (switch or push-button) the command BASIC\_SET ON or BASIC\_SET OFF to the associated device. This command is reflected to the output of associated device. Supports the following command classes:

BASIC_SET : set On / Off state at the associated device

Association group 2 supports 9 nodes.

### Group 3: Association Group 3

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class). Triggered by SW (SW1)
Supports the following command classes:

1. SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE : initiate a transition to a new level (increase or decrease light intensity in case of dimmer, or move shutter up or down, …)

2. SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_STOP\_LEVEL\_CHANGE : stop an ongoing transition (stop increase or decrease light intensity in case of dimmer, or stop moving shutter up or down, …)

It is recommended to use push buttons for this association.

Association group 3 supports 9 nodes.

### Group 4: Association Group 4

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW2 terminal (uses Basic command class). Triggered by SW2.
Supports the following command classes:

BASIC_SET : set On / Off state at the associated device

Association group 4 supports 9 nodes.

### Group 5: Association Group 5

It is assigned to switch connected to the SW2 terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class). Triggered by SW2.
Supports the following command classes:

SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_START\_LEVEL\_CHANGE : initiate a transition to a new level (increase or decrease light intensity in case of dimmer, or move shutter up or down, …)

SWITCH\_MULTILEVEL\_STOP\_LEVEL\_CHANGE : stop an ongoing transition (stop increase or decrease light intensity in case of dimmer, or stop moving shutter up or down, …)

It is recommended to use push buttons for this association.

Association group 5 supports 9 nodes.
