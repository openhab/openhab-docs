The ZW112 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW112 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Door/ Window Sensor 6 is a smart Z-Wave sensor that can detect the status of door/window's open/close in real time.   
It’s a security Z-Wave device that supports security encryption. Also it supports the “Over the Air Firmware Updating” that allows you wirelessly update its firmware if needs.  
It can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from manufacturers and/or other applications.

### Inclusion Information

Turn the primary controller into inclusion mode, short press the product’s Action Button that you can find in the back of the product.

### Exclusion Information

Turn the primary controller into exclusion mode, short press the product’s Action Button that you can find in back of the product.

### Wakeup Information

The ZW112 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Press the Action Button once, which will trigger sending out the Wake up notification command, press and hold the Action Button for 3 seconds, which will toggle on/off the Sensor be waked up for 10 minutes.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW112 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Door Sensor

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

| 39 | Low battery threshold (10% to 50%) | The value the sensor will use to determine a low battery level |
| 101 | Low battery voltage check | Enable or disables the low battery voltage check |
| 111 | Low battery voltage check time | Sets the value of the interval for the low battery check time (in seconds) |
| 121 | Reporting mode on open/close event |  |
| 252 | Lock/Unlock all configuration parameters |  |
| 255 | Reset sensor to factory default and remove from network | Reset sensor to factory default and remove from network |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Value that will be sent on open/close events



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | On for opened, Off for closed |
| 1 | Off for opened, On for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (On for opened, Off for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 39: Low battery threshold (10% to 50%)

The value the sensor will use to determine a low battery level

Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_39_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 101: Low battery voltage check

Enable or disables the low battery voltage check

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_101_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 111: Low battery voltage check time

Sets the value of the interval for the low battery check time (in seconds)

Values in the range 240 to 134217727 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```86640```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_111_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 121: Reporting mode on open/close event

Reset sensor to factory default and remove from network
Writing 1431655765 to this parameter will reset to factory default and the sensor will be removed from network.

Values in the range 0 to 2147483647 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW112 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Sends sensor report as configured in parameter 121 when the sensor is triggered
This group supports 5 nodes.
