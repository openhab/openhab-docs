The DSB54 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DSB54 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeotec Recessed Door Sensor Gen5 has been crafted to power connected lighting using Z-Wave Plus.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Place your gateway or controller into Z-Wave pair or inclusion mode.
  2. Press the Action Button on your Sensor.
  3. If your Sensor has been successfully linked to your network, its LED will become solid for 2 seconds then disappear. If linking was unsuccessful, the LED will continue to blink if you tap its button.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Place your gateway or controller into Z-Wave unpair or exclusion mode
  2. Press the Action Button on your Sensor.
  3. If your switch has been successfully unlinked to your network, its LED will begin to blink for a short time. If linking was unsuccessful, the LED will return to its last state. Tap the button to confirm if it has been unpaired, if unpaired successfully, the LED will blink when tapped.

### Wakeup Information

The DSB54 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 6 seconds

### General Usage Information

Reset:

At some stage, you may wish to reset all of your Recessed Door Sensor's settings to their factory defaults. 

  * To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your sensor will now be reset to its original settings

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSB54 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door Sensor
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```112```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_111_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_2_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSB54 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: State Updates


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Battery Warnings


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
