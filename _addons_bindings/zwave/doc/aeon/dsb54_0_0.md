# DSB54 Recessed Door/Window Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *DSB54*, manufactured by *[AEON Labs](http://aeotec.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```aeon_dsb54_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The DSB54 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DSB54 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/68) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSB54 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Door Sensor

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the DSB54.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Send Sensor binary report on open/close events |  |
| 3 | Send Basic Set on open/close event |  |
| 101 | Low battery voltage check | parameter defines, if battery check function is possible, when battery is below warning voltage |
| 111 | Low battery voltage check time | Minimum battery low check Interval time is 4 minutes (240 seconds) |
| 121 | Flag values for triggered magnet switch | Flag values for which reports to send when the magnet switch is triggered |
| 252 | Permit other configurations | Lock or Unlock other configuration set function |
| 255 | Reset to default | Reset to the default configuration |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Send Sensor binary report on open/close events



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | On for opened, Off for closed |
| 1 | Off for opened, On for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (On for opened, Off for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Send Basic Set on open/close event



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | On for opened, Off for closed |
| 1 | Off for opened, On for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (On for opened, Off for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 101: Low battery voltage check

parameter defines, if battery check function is possible, when battery is below warning voltage

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_101_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 111: Low battery voltage check time

Minimum battery low check Interval time is 4 minutes (240 seconds)

Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```112```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_111_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 121: Flag values for triggered magnet switch

Flag values for which reports to send when the magnet switch is triggered

Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```256```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_121_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 252: Permit other configurations

Lock or Unlock other configuration set function

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Unlock |
| 1 | Lock |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Unlock).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_252_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 255: Reset to default

Reset to the default configuration

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Reset |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Reset).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_2_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSB54 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: State Updates


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Battery Warnings


This group supports 5 nodes.
