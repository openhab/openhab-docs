The DSA38 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Aeon Labs Panic Button is a fully functional Z-Wave remote control capable of adding, removing, and controlling other Z-Wave devices. it can also become a secondary or inclusion controller to a SIS gateway in the Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Press the Learn button on your Panic Button with the pin or press the bottom- right action button. Your Panic Button’s green light will begin to pulse.
  2. When Panic Button successfully joins your Z-Wave network, its LED will flash green slowly 3 times and then quickly flash green for 2 seconds before turning solid green for 2 seconds.
  3. Should the LED continue to flash green for 30 seconds before turning off, it has been unable to join your Z-Wave network; repeat the above steps and please contact us for further support if needed.

### Exclusion Information

Reset:

Your Panic Button can be reset to default factory settings with ease.

  1. Press and hold the Learn button for 20 seconds with a pin.
  2. The green and red light will alternate for 20 seconds, then the green light will stay solid for 2 seconds to indicate a successful reset

### Wakeup Information

The DSA38 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

### General Usage Information

Reset:

Your Panic Button can be reset to default factory settings with ease.

  1. Press and hold the Learn button for 20 seconds with a pin.
  2. The green and red light will alternate for 20 seconds, then the green light will stay solid for 2 seconds to indicate a successful reset

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSA38 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the DSA38.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 250 | Mode of Button 1  | Defines the switching mode of Button 1 |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 250: Mode of Button 1 

Defines the switching mode of Button 1

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Factory Default |
| 1 | Scene Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Factory Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_250_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSA38 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Scene 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
