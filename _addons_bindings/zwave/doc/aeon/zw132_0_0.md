The ZW132 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Aeotec Dual Nano Switch is a low-cost Z-Wave Switch specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) of any wall switches. It can report immediate wattage consumption or kWh energy usage over a period of time. In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the unit’s operating status.

It can connect to 2 external manual switches to control the load ON/OFF independently. Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Dual Nano Switch.

The Dual Nano Switch is also a security Z-Wave device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.

**Reset your Dual Nano Switch.**

If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Dual Nano Switch’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your Dual Nano Switch will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then remain the colourful gradient status as a confirmation.

### Inclusion Information

**Including Dual Nano Switch as a non-secure device:**

If you want your Dual Nano Switch as a non-secure device in your Z-Wave network, press the Action Button once on Dual Nano Switch when you pair it to your gateway. If inclusion is successful, the green LED will be on for 2 seconds, and then return to a solid indication. If inclusion is unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then return to a colourful gradient.

**Including Dual Nano Switch as a secure device:**

In order to take full advantage of the Dual Nano Switch, you will want your Dual Nano Switch as a security device that uses encrypted messages to communicate in your Z-wave network. A security enabled controller/gateway (or Z-Wave Plus controller) is required.

1. Set your Z-Wave Plus controller into pairing mode.
2. Press the Action Button 2 times within 1 second on the Dual Nano Switch, the blue LED (secure indication) will blink to indicate the Dual Nano Switch is entering into secure pairing mode.
3. If the Dual Nano Switch has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid. If the pairing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain a colourful gradient, repeat the instructions above from step 1.
