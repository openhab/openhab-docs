## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW132 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

When the load state of Dual Nano Switch (turn on/off the load) is changed, the Hail CC and Basic Report (configured by parameter 80) can be sent to the associated nodes in this group.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Forward the Basic Set

Switch All, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Dual Nano Switch receives the Basic Set, Switch All, Scene Activation Set commands from main controller. (E.g. Send/forward Basic Set to control the other nodes in association Group
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Send Basic Set
