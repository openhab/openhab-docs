## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSB05 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | Temperature | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (relative humidity)

Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (luminance)

Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

| 2 | send Sensor Binary report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Send Basic Set).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 101: Which reports to send to group 1

Group 1 automatic report list
The value is a combination number made up of the sum of the values for the individual sensors and battery.

The sensors have the values:

Temperature=32

Humidity=64

Lightlevel=128

Battery=1

Therefore if you want all sensors and the battery report set this value to **225** (recommended)
Values in the range 0 to 225 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_101_4_000000FF``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 102: Which reports to send to group 2

Group 2 automatic report list
The value is a combination number made up of the sum of the values for the individual sensors and battery.

The sensors have the values:

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_1_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSB05 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1 devices


This group supports 5 nodes.
