The ZW062 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Garage Door Controller is a smart and wireless Garage Door Control system, you can control the garage door to open, close, or stop moving via wireless signal on your gateway client or phone application.

The Garage Door Controller allows you to configure different alarm sounds to indicate the door ’s action.

Each action alarm sound can be customized. To change or update new alarm sounds for the Garage Door Controller, connect the Garage Door Controller to your PC host with a USB cable and download your sound files to the flash memory (128 MB) of the Garage Door Controller.

It can be included and operated in any Z-wave network with other Z-wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

It is also a security Z-wave device and supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.

### Inclusion Information

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW062 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Position status changed
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Forward the Basic Set
This group supports 5 nodes.
