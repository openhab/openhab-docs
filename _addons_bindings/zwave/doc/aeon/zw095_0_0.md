The ZW095 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Home Energy Meter is energy meter for the entire home. It can wirelessly report instantaneous

Power, KWH, Voltage and Amperage measurements to Z‐Wave gateway/controller. It can send Z‐Wave

REPORTS (Meter v3 Command Class) at any time when it receives Z‐Wave Get Commands.

The HEM can be setup to send automatic reports to any associated nodes in association group 1 at an

interval time

The HEM can independently report the measurements from the Clamps via the Multi Channel Command

Class encapsulation.

It can be included and operated in any Z‐wave network with other Z‐wave certified devices from other

manufacturers and/or other applications. All non‐battery operated nodes within the network will act as

repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

It also supports Security Command Class and has the AES‐128 bit security encryption built right in. While a

Security enabled Controller is needed in order to fully use the security feature.

### Parameter 101: Report Group 1

Which reports need to send in Report group 1
This page provides examples for setting the type of reports you want from the clamps and total readings using Parameter 101-103 for Home Energy Meter Gen5 and form part of the larger Home Energy Meter Gen5 user guide.

To set specific reports for your HEM Gen5, refer to the decimal table below if you do not know how to read a binary table. All you will need to do is add the decimal values together of all the settings you want, and then utilize the sum as the parameter setting value.

The table above shows a decimal representation of all flags that can be set on parameter 101-103 to report specific data.

**Example use of the Report Table.**

For example, if you want to report only the total KWH consumption, and the Wattage for clamp 3, you would add 1 + 1024 and set the sum (1025) to parameter 101, 102, or 103.

As another example, if you want to report Wattage and KWH power consumption for all clamps, you would add 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 4096 + 8192, then set the sum (16128) to parameter 101, 102, or 103.

And if you want to report everything, you would add the whole table together and set it to 101, and set 102 and 103 to 0 values.

**Setting an automatic report interval.**

Parameter 111-113 \[4 byte dec\] can be configured through your gateway in case the default settings of your HEM is not what you desire.

Parameter 111 will set the interval for Group 1 (parameter 101), parameter 112 will set the interval for Group 2 (parameter 102), and parameter 113 will set the interval for Group 3 (parameter 103).

As an example, you have set parameter 101 to report the total KWH consumption and the wattage for clamp 3, and you want to report it every 500 seconds. Set Parameter 111 \[4 byte dec\] to 500.

**Utilizing different groups.**

Your Home Energy Meter has 3 different groups that you may setup, from the settings and examples above, you may configure each group to report different clamps and total reports to report at different interval. Group 1 uses Parameter 101 and 111, group 2 uses parameter 102 and 112, and group 3 uses parameter 103 and 113.
Values in the range 0 to 2147483647 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Do nothing).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW095 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3


This group supports 5 nodes.
