## Overview

Aeon Labs Z‐Stick Gen5 is a self‐powered Z‐Wave USB adapter with remote network creation capabilities  
(independent from external power and host microprocessor).  By being able to remotely include/remove Z‐  
Wave devices, this greatly simplifies Z‐Wave network installation.  When connected to a host controller (via  
USB), it enables the host controller to take part in the Z‐Wave Network.  
It can be included and operated in any Z‐wave network with other Z‐wave certified devices from other  
manufacturers and/or other applications. All non‐battery operated nodes within the network will act as  
repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. 

### Inclusion Information

Push the include button.  Controller will blink slowly.  It is in include mode.  Press again to cancel.

### Exclusion Information

1. Unplug the Z‐Stick from the USB connector. Then press and hold the Action Button for  
approximately 2 seconds. (The orange LED will blinking fast.)  
2. To remove a Z‐Wave device from the network, simply go to the device with the Z‐Stick  
and press the Action Button on the device you wish to remove. (The LED on the Z‐Stick will  
become blue and Immediately stay solid for 2 seconds to indicate successful removal from  
the network.)  
3.   The orange LED will then return to blinking fast, indicating readiness for further device  
exclusions. Repeat step 1 for each device as you wish to exclude
