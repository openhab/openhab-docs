The DSB29 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DSB29 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Door & Window Sensor finds out something very simple – whether a door or a window, or in fact any object in your home, is open or closed. But there’s power in simplicity. Power that allows you to inform the rest of your Z-Wave network about your selected doors and windows. Like a thermostat lets your heating and cooling systems know what they should do next, Aeotec’s Z-Wave Door & Window Sensor does the same. Perhaps an open door means that your lights should turn on and welcome you home. Perhaps an open window means that an alarm should be triggered. Whatever it means to your home, with door and window sensors installed, your Z-Wave network will have both the power and the intelligence to do it.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Let your Z-Wave primary controller/gateway enter into adding/inclusion mode. 
  2. Take your Sensor near to your primary controller. 
  3. Press the Action Button once on your Sensor. 
  4. If your Door Window Sensor has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its Status LED will fast blink for 2 seconds and then be solid for 2 seconds when you press the Action Button again. If the adding was unsuccessful and the Status LED continues to fast blink for 8 seconds and then slow blink for 3 seconds, repeat the above steps.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put your primary controller into device removal mode. 
  2. Unlock your Sensor from the Back Mount plate and take the Sensor unit near to your primary controller.  
  3. Press the Action Button on your Sensor. 
  4. If your Door Window Sensor has been successfully removed from your Z-Wave network, its Status LED will fast blink for 8 seconds and then slow blink for 3 seconds when you press the Action Button again. If the removing was unsuccessful, the Status LED will fast blink for 2 seconds and then be solid for 2 seconds when you press the Action Button, repeat the above steps.

### Wakeup Information

The DSB29 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


  1. Remove your Sensor unit from its Back Mounting Plate, press  the Action Button on the back of the Sensor unit and then release the Action Button. This will trigger and send a wake up notification command to your controller/gateway. 
  2. If you want your Sensor to keep awake for a longer time, press and hold the Action Button on the back of the Sensor unit for 3 seconds, then your Sensor will wake up for 10 minutes and the Status LED will fast blink while it is awake. 

### General Usage Information

Factory Reset: If your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Door Window Sensor’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this: 

  * Press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and Status LED will be solid for 2 seconds to confirm a success.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSB29 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (general)
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Send Basic Set on open/close event



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | On for opened, Off for closed |
| 1 | Off for opened, On for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (On for opened, Off for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 121: command class to use for open/close

parameter 4 (LSB)
Set to 0 for no report

Set to 1 for BATTERY report

Set to 16 for SENSOR_BINARY report

Set to 17 for SENSOR_BINARY and BATTERY
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | not set |
| 1 | BATTERY report |
| 16 | SENSOR BINARY report |
| 17 | SENSOR BINARY and BATTERY report |

### Parameter 121: command class to use for open/close

see overview (parameter 3)
set to 0 for no report

| 0 | not set |
| 1 | BASIC report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (BASIC report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_121_4_0000FF00``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSB29 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
