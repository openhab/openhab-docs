# DSB29 Door/Window sensor Gen2
This describes the Z-Wave device *DSB29*, manufactured by *[AEON Labs](http://aeotec.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```aeon_dsb29_00_000```.

The DSB29 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DSB29 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The DSB29 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSB29 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (general)

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the DSB29.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Send Sensor binary report on open/close events |  |
| 2 | Enable wake up 10 minutes when power on |  |
| 3 | Send Basic Set on open/close event |  |
| 121 | command class to use for open/close | parameter 4 (LSB) |
| 121 | command class to use for open/close | see overview (parameter 3) |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Send Sensor binary report on open/close events



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | On for opened, Off for closed |
| 1 | Off for opened, On for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (On for opened, Off for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Enable wake up 10 minutes when power on



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Send Basic Set on open/close event



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | On for opened, Off for closed |
| 1 | Off for opened, On for closed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (On for opened, Off for closed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 121: command class to use for open/close

parameter 4 (LSB)
Set to 0 for no report

Set to 1 for BATTERY report

Set to 16 for SENSOR\_BINARY report

Set to 17 for SENSOR\_BINARY and BATTERY
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | not set |
| 1 | BATTERY report |
| 16 | SENSOR BINARY report |
| 17 | SENSOR BINARY and BATTERY report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (not set).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_121_4_000000FF``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 121: command class to use for open/close

see overview (parameter 3)
set to 0 for no report

set to 1 for BASIC report (default)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | not set |
| 1 | BASIC report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (BASIC report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_121_4_0000FF00``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSB29 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.
