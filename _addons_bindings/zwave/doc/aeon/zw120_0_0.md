The ZW120 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW120 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Door/ Window Sensor Gen5 is a smart Z-Wave sensor that can detect the status of door/window's open/close in real time. It’s a security Z-Wave device that supports security encryption. It can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from manufacturers and/or other applications.

### Inclusion Information

To include your Sensor as a non-security device in your Z-wave network, turn the primary controller into inclusion mode, then press the Action Button once on Door Window Sensor. To include your Sensor as a secure device, turn the primary controller into inclusion mode, then press the Sensor’s Action Button 2 times within 1 second

### Exclusion Information

To exclude your sensor from the z-wave network, turn the primary controller into exclusion mode, then press the Action Button once on Door Window Sensor.

### Wakeup Information

Remove your Sensor unit from its Back Mounting Plate, press the Action Button on the back of the Sensor unit and then release the Action Button. This will trigger and send a wake up notification command to your controller/gateway.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW120 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Sensor | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Door Sensor

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (general)

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW120 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.
