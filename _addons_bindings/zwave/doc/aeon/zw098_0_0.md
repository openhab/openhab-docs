## Overview

Aeon Labs LED Bulb is a switch multilevel device based on Z-wave enhanced 232 slave library of V6.51.06. Its bulb has the Smart RGB LEDs in, which can be used for adding colour to your home, the bulb has 5 main colour channels available for you to adjust: Red, Green, Blue, Warm white and Cold white. You can configure its indication colour according to your favour.

The LED Bulb can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

The LED Bulb is a security Z-Wave device, so a security enabled controller is needed for take full advantage of all functionally for the LED Bulb. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade.
