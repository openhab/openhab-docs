The ZW140 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Aeotec Dual Nano Switch is a Z-Wave Smart Switch specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) of any wall switches.   
In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the unitâ€™s operating status.   
It can connect to 2 external manual switches to control the load ON/OFF independently. Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Dual Nano Switch.   
The Dual Nano Switch is also a security Z-Wave device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW140 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Z-Wave Plus Lifeline. When the load state of Dual Nano Switch (turn on/off the load) is changed, the Hail CC and Basic Report (configured by parameter 80) can be sent to the associated nodes in this group.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Forward the Basic Set

Forward the Basic Set, Switch All, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Dual Nano Switch receives the Basic Set, Switch All, Scene Activation Set commands from main controller. (E.g. Send/forward Basic Set to control the other node
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x51 )

Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x51 ) to the associated nodes in Group 3 when the external switch S1 is operated. Note: The Switch Mode of external switch S1 should be identified successfully, which means that the value of Configuration parameter
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x52)

Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x52) to the associated nodes in Group 4 when the external switch S2 is operated. Note: The Switch Mode of external switch S2 should be identified successfully, which means that the value of Configuration parameter
