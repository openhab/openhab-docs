## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW078 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

The Node IDs in Group 1 will receive Hail Command/Basic report (configurable) when Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5's level changed.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

When the Heavy Duty Smart Switch Gen5 receives the commands Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, or Scene Activation Set it will forward the commands to all node IDs (in Group 2).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
