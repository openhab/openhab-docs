The ZW111 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeotec Nano Dimmer is a Z-Wave Smart Dimmer specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off/dim) of any wall switches. It can report immediate wattage consumption or kWh energy usage over a period of time. In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the unit’s operating status.   
It can connect to 2 external manual switches to control the load ON/OFF independently. Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Nano Dimmer.   
The Nano Dimmer is also a security Z-Wave plus device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.

### Inclusion Information

Including Nano Dimmer as a non-secure device:

If you want your Nano Dimmer as a non-secure device in your Z-Wave network, press the Action Button once on Nano Dimmer when you pair it to your gateway. If inclusion is successful, the green LED will be on for 2 seconds, and then return to a solid indication. If inclusion is unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then return to a colourful gradient.

Including Nano Dimmer as a secure device:

In order to take full advantage of the Nano Dimmer, you will want your Nano Dimmer as a security device that uses encrypted messages to communicate in your Z-wave network. A security enabled controller/ gateway (or Z-Wave Plus controller) is required.

  1. Set your Z-Wave Plus controller into pairing mode.
  2. Press the Action Button 2 times within 1 second on the Nano Dimmer, the blue LED (secure indication) will blink to indicate the Nano Dimmer is entering into secure pairing mode.
  3. If the Nano Dimmer has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid. If the pairing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain a colourful gradient, repeat the instructions above from step 1.

### Exclusion Information

Your Nano Dimmer can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You’ll need to use your Z-Wave network’s main controller. To set your Z-Wave controller/gateway into removal mode, please refer to the respective section within your controller instruction manual.

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into removal mode.
  2. Press the Action Button on the Nano Dimmer or toggle the external manual switch 2 times in fast succession.
  3. If the Nano Dimmer has been successfully removed from your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will remain colourful gradient. If the removal was unsuccessful, the RGB LED will still be solid (following the state of the output load), repeat the instructions above from step 1.

### General Usage Information

Reset your Nano Dimmer.

If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Nano Dimmer’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your Nano Dimmer will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then remain the colourful gradient status as a confirmation

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW111 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline. When the load state of Nano Dimmer (on/off/dim the load ) is changed, the Hail CC, Switch Multilevel Report and Basic Report (configured by parameter 80) can be sent to the associated nodes in this group.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Forward

Forward the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, Switch Multilevel Start Level Change, Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change, Switch Multilevel Set, Switch all to the associated nodes in Group 2 when the Nano Dimmer receives the Basic Set, Switch Binary Set, Switch Multilevel Start Level Change, Switch Multilevel Stop Level Change, Switch Multilevel Set, Switch all commands from main controller.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Send Basic Set (Group 3) Sw 1

Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x51 ) to the associated nodes in Group 3 when the external switch S1 is operated

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Send Basic Set (Group 3) Sw 2

Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x52) to the associated nodes in Group 4 when the external switch S2 is operated

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
