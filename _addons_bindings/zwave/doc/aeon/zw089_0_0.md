The ZW089 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW089 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeon Labs Recessed Door Sensor Gen5 is a door detector that can detect the state of the door's open/close.

### Inclusion Information

1. Power on the Recessed Door Sensor Gen5.
2. Let the primary controller into inclusion mode (If you don’t know how to do this, refer to its manual).
3. Press the Z‐Wave button.
4. If the inclusion is success, Recessed Door Sensor Gen5’s LED will be kept turning on for 10 minutes. If the LED still blinks slowly, in which you need to repeat the process from step 2.

### Exclusion Information

1. Power on the Recessed Door Sensor Gen5.
2. Let the primary controller into exclusion mode (If you don’t know how to do this, refer to its manual).
3. Press the Z‐Wave button.
4. If the exclusion is success, Recessed Door Sensor Gen5’s LED will blink slowly. If LED still be solid status for 3 seconds after you short press the Z‐Wave button, in which you need to repeat the process from step 2

### Wakeup Information

The ZW089 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Press and hold the Z‐wave Button for 6 seconds. It will sleep after you released the z‐wave button for 10 seconds, or sleep right away when received the Wake Up No More Information and then the led will turn off.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW089 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Status | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Door Status

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_1_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW089 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: State Updates


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Battery Warnings


This group supports 5 nodes.
