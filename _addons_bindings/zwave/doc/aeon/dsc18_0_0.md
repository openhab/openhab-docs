The DSC18 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is a low-cost Z-Wave appliance module specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/ off) for existing in-wall switches. It can also report immediate wattage consumption or kWh energy usage over a period of time

### Inclusion Information

While the Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is powered in a 3-wire system, the external switch/button can be toggled to initiate pairing into the Z-Wave network. Or the internal button can be pushed to initiate pairing into the Z-Wave network if the Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not put into in-wall box. 

Troubleshooting:

If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not successfully included into any Z-Wave network, the LED will continually blink slowly. If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will either be solid on or off depending on if the switch is on or off. 

### Exclusion Information

While the Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is powered in a 3-wire system, the external switch/button can be toggled 10 times in quick succession to initiate removing from the Z-Wave network. Or the internal button can be pushed to initiate pairing into the Z-Wave network if Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not put into in-wall box.

Troubleshooting: If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was removed from the Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will be blinking. If the Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not successfully removed from the Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will either be solid on or off depending on if the switch is on or off

### General Usage Information

Reset:

If Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 was not put into in-wall box, Another way to reset Aeotec Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 is pressing and holding the button which is on Micro Smart Energy Switch G2 20 seconds.
