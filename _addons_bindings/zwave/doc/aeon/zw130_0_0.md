The ZW130 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW130 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Aeotec WallMote Quad is an intelligent Z-Wave remote controller that mounted on a wall.

It has 4 touch buttons that you can easily control the Z-Wave devices in your home network via touching, long pressing or sliding the button areas. Its surface has a RGB LED to indicate the button actions also accompanied by touch beep and vibration.

The WallMote Quad is also a security Z-Wave device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.

### Inclusion Information

**Including WallMote Quad as a non-secure device:**

If you want your WallMote Quad as a non-security device in your Z-wave network, you just need to press the Action Button once on WallMote Quad when you use a controller/gateway to add/include it. The green LED will be on for 2 seconds and then the orange LED will fast blink for 10 minutes (if the WallMote Quad does not receive the Wake Up No More Info command from primary Controller) to indicate the inclusion is successful

**Including WallMote Quad as a secure device:**

In order to take full advantage of all functionality the WallMote Quad, you may want your WallMote Quad is a security device that uses secure/encrypted message to communicate in Z-wave network, so a security enabled controller/gateway is needed for the WallMote Quad to be used as a security device. You need to press the WallMote Quadâ€™s Action Button 2 times within 1 second when your security controller/gateway starts the network inclusion. The blue LED will be on for 2 seconds and then the orange LED will fast blink for 10 minutes (if the WallMote Quad does not receive the Wake Up No More Info command from primary Controller) to indicate the inclusion is successful.

### Exclusion Information

Your WallMote Quad can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You'll need to use your Z-Wave network's main controller/ gateway. To do this, please refer to the part of their respective manuals that tell you how to remove devices from your network.

  1. Put your primary controller into device removal mode.
  2. Unlock your WallMote Quad from the Back Mount plate and take the WallMote Quad unit near to your primary controller.
  3. Press the Action Button on your WallMote Quad.

If your WallMote Quad is successfully removed from the Z-Wave network, the LED will become a colourful gradient for a few seconds and then turn off. If the removing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then turn off, repeat the above steps.

### Wakeup Information

The ZW130 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


In order to send your WallMote Quad new configuration commands from your Z-Wave controller or gateway, it will need to be woken up.

Remove your WallMote Quad unit from its Back Mounting Plate, press and hold the Action Button for 3 seconds(the buzzer chirp once and the orange LED will be ON) on the back of the WallMote Quad unit and then release it. This will trigger and send a wake up notification command to your controller/gateway, then your WallMote Quad will wake up for 10 minutes and the orange LED will fast blink while it is awake (if the WallMote Quad does not receive the Wake Up No More Info from the primary Controller).

### General Usage Information

You need to add the Controller to the association groups for Basic and Multilevel for each button in order to get on/off and increase/decrease notifications on the appropriate channel.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW130 supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Central Scene Notification
When touching the Button 1 to 4, the Central Scene Notificcation command will be sent to the associated node (1) in Association group 1.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Button 1 basic

On/off control via button 1
When touching the Button 1, the Basic Set command will be sent to the associated nodes in Association group 2.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Button 1 multilevel

Dim control via button 1
When touching the Button 1, the Multilevel Switch Set command will be sent to the associated nodes in Association group 3

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Button 2 basic

On/off control via button 2
When touching the Button 2, the Basic Set command will be sent to the associated nodes in Association group 4.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Button 2 multilevel

Dim control via button 2
When touching the Button 2, the Multilevel Switch Set command will be sent to the associated nodes in Association group 5.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Button 3 basic

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 7: Button 3 multilevel

Dim control via button 3
When touching the Button 3, the Multilevel Switch Set command will be sent to the associated nodes in Association group 7.
