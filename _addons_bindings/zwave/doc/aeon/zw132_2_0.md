    <td>
      <p>
        <br />Aeotec Dual Nano Switch is a low-cost Z-Wave Switch specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) of any wall switches. It can report immediate wattage consumption or kWh energy usage over a period of time. In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the unit’s operating status.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It can connect to 2 external manual switches to control the load ON/OFF independently. Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Dual Nano Switch.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Dual Nano Switch is also a security Z-Wave device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Reset your Dual Nano Switch.</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Dual Nano Switch’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your Dual Nano Switch will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then remain the colourful gradient status as a confirmation.

### Inclusion Information

**Including Dual Nano Switch as a non-secure device:**

If you want your Dual Nano Switch as a non-secure device in your Z-Wave network, press the Action Button once on Dual Nano Switch when you pair it to your gateway. If inclusion is successful, the green LED will be on for 2 seconds, and then return to a solid indication. If inclusion is unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then return to a colourful gradient.

**Including Dual Nano Switch as a secure device:**

In order to take full advantage of the Dual Nano Switch, you will want your Dual Nano Switch as a security device that uses encrypted messages to communicate in your Z-wave network. A security enabled controller/gateway (or Z-Wave Plus controller) is required.

  1. Set your Z-Wave Plus controller into pairing mode.
  2. Press the Action Button 2 times within 1 second on the Dual Nano Switch, the blue LED (secure indication) will blink to indicate the Dual Nano Switch is entering into secure pairing mode.
  3. If the Dual Nano Switch has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid. If the pairing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain a colourful gradient, repeat the instructions above from step 1.

### Exclusion Information

**Removing Dual Nano Switch from a Z-Wave network.**

Your Dual Nano Switch can be removed from your Z-Wave network at any time. You’ll need to use your Z-Wave network’s main controller. To set your Z-Wave controller/gateway into removal mode, please refer to the respective section within your controller instruction manual.

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into removal mode.
  2. Press the Action Button on the Dual Nano Switch or toggle the external manual switch 3 times in fast succession.
  3. If the Dual Nano Switch has been successfully removed from your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will remain colourful gradient. If the removal was unsuccessful, the RGB LED will still be solid (following the state of the output load), repeat the instructions above from step 1.

| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW132 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
When the load state of Dual Nano Switch (turn on/off the load) is changed, the Hail CC and Basic Report (configured by parameter 80) can be sent to the associated nodes in this group.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Forward the Basic Set

Switch All, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Dual Nano Switch receives the Basic Set, Switch All, Scene Activation Set commands from main controller. (E.g. Send/forward Basic Set to control the other nodes in association Group

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Send Basic Set 

(configured by parameter 0x51 ) to the associated nodes in Group 3 when the external switch S1 is operated. Note: The Switch Mode of external switch S1 should be identified successfully, which means that the value of Configuration parameter 0x78 should be

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Send Basic Set

Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x52) to the associated nodes in Group 4 when the external switch S2 is operated. Note: The Switch Mode of external switch S2 should be identified successfully, which means that the value of Configuration parameter

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
