The ZW097 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW097 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

A fully functional Z-Wave sensor that can detect a variety of dry contact signals. You just need to connect the matched external sensor on it such as a water level sensor, dry contact switch, dry contact relay, or other possible dry contact sensors. The Dry Contact Sensor can be used if the external sensor is a dry contact device. 

### Inclusion Information

  1. Remove the spacing tab to connect the batteries on your Dry Contact Sensor. Its Network LED will begin to blink when you short press the Action Button on the back of Sensor.
  2. Put your controller into inclusion mode. 
  3. Press the Action Button on your Dry Contact Sensor.
  4. If your Dry Contact Sensor has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its Network LED will fast blink for 2 seconds and then be solid for 2 seconds when you press the Action Button again. If the adding was unsuccessful and the Network LED continues to fast blink for 8 seconds and then slow blink for 3 seconds, repeat the above steps.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put your controller into exclusion mode.
  2. Press the Action Button on your Dry Contact Sensor. If your Dry Contact Sensor has been successfully removed from your Z-Wave network, its Network LED will fast blink for 8 seconds and then slow blink for 3 seconds when you press the Action Button again.  
    If the removing was unsuccessful, the Network LED will fast blink for 2 seconds and then be solid for 2 seconds when you press the Action Button, repeat the above steps.

### Wakeup Information

The ZW097 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


  1. Remove your Sensor unit from its Back Mounting Plate, press the Action Button on the back of the Sensor unit and then release the Action Button. This will trigger and send a wake up notification command to your controller/gateway.
  2. If you want your Sensor to keep awake for a longer time, press and hold the Action Button on the back of the Sensor unit for 3 seconds, then your Sensor will wake up for 10 minutes and the Network LED will fast blink while it is awake.

This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW097 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
