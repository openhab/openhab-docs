The DSC06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Aeon Labs Smart Energy Switch is a Z-Wave appliance switch which can report wattage energy usage or kWh energy usage to a Z-Wave gateway. It can also be controlled by other Z-Wave devices to turn on/off to save electricity when appropriate.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Plug the Smart Energy Switch into an outlet
  2. Put the controller in inclusion mode
  3. Press the button located between the LED

If the Aeon Labs Smart Energy Switch was not successfully included into any Z-Wave network, the LED will be blinking. If the Aeon Labs Smart Energy Switch was successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the LED will either be on or off (depending on if the switch is on or off). 

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put the controller in exclusion mode
  2. Press the button located between the LED

If the Aeon Labs Smart Energy Switch was removed from the Z-Wave network, the LED will be blinking. If the Aeon Labs Smart Energy Switch was not successfully removed from the Z-Wave network, the LED will either be on or off (depending on if the switch is on or off).
