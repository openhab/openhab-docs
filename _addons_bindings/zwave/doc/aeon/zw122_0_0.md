# ZW122 Water Sensor 6
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZW122*, manufactured by *[AEON Labs](http://aeotec.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```aeon_zw122_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The ZW122 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW122 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ZW122Â  contains 4 sensing points, which would be more accurately to detect the presence and absence of water or detect whether there is water leak in some places of your home. The Water Sensor 6 has an inbuilt buzzer that can play alarm sounds to let you know when the water is detected.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Let your Z-Wave primary controller/gateway enter into adding/inclusion mode. Take your Sensor near to your primary controller.
  2. Press the Action Button once on your Sensor, the green LED will blink.
  3. If your Water Sensor has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then the orange LED will fast blink for 10 minutes if the Sensor does not receive the Wake Up No More info Command from Controller. If the adding was unsuccessful and the red LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then become colourful gradient for a few seconds before it turns off, repeat the above steps.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Turn your primary controller into device removal mode. Take the Sensor unit near to your primary controller.
  2. Press the Action Button on your Sensor.
  3. If your Water Sensor is successfully removed from the Z-Wave network, the RGB LED will become a colourful gradient for a few seconds and then turn off. If the removing was unsuccessful, the blue LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then turn off, repeat the above steps

### Wakeup Information

The ZW122 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press the Action Button on the Sensor unit and then release the Action Button. This will trigger and send a wake up notification command to your controller/gateway.  
If you want your Sensor to keep awake for a longer time, press and hold the Action Button on the back of the Sensor unit for 3 seconds, then your Sensor will wake up for 10 minutes and the orange LED will fast blink while it is awake.

This is a read only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW122 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Sensor Status


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Sensor 1 Alarm


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor 2 Alarm


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
