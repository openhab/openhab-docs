## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW139 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
When the load state of Nano Switch (turn on/off the load) is changed, the Hail CC and Basic Report (configured by parameter 80) can be sent to the associated nodes in this group.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Forward Group 2

Forward the Basic Set, Switch All, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Dual Nano Switch receives the Basic Set, Switch All, Scene Activation Set commands from main controller.  
(E.g. Send/forward Basic Set to control the other nodes in association Group 2)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Send Basic Set to Group 3

Send Basic Set (configured by parameter 0x51 ) to the associated nodes in Group 3 when the external switch S1 is operated.  
Note: The Switch Mode of external switch S1 should be identified successfully, which means that the value of Configuration parameter 0x78 should be non-zero, then the Basic Set can be sent to the associated nodes in Group 3 via triggering the S1 switch.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Send Basic Set to Group 4

Send Basic Set (enabled by Configuration parameter 0x52) to the associated nodes in Group 4 when the external switch S2 is operated.  
Note: The Switch Mode of external switch S2 should be identified successfully, which means that the value of Configuration

parameter 0x79 should be non-zero, then the Basic Set can be sent to the associated nodes in Group 3 via triggering the S2 switch.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
