# DSC12 Micro Smart Energy Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *DSC12*, manufactured by *[AEON Labs](http://aeotec.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```aeon_dsc12_00_000```.

The DSC12 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/277) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSC12 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Sensor (power) | sensor_power | Energy | Number |

| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Sensor (power)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```sensor_power``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DSC12 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Target for automatic meter reports


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Target for automatic reports


This group supports 5 nodes.
