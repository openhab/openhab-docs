# DSC13 Micro Smart Energy Illuminator
This describes the Z-Wave device *DSC13*, manufactured by *[AEON Labs](http://aeotec.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```aeon_dsc13_00_000```.

The DSC13 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/287) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DSC13 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer |
