# ZW15SM Binary Switch + Meter
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZW15SM*, manufactured by *Wenzhou MTLC Electric Appliances Co.,Ltd.* with the thing type UID of ```enerwave_zw15sm_00_000```.

The ZW15SM supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

### Inclusion Information

The process of "Inclusion/ Exclusion" is to Add or Remove the device from the Hub. All Z-Wave devices must be "Included" on the Controller (Hub) before it can be controlled from a smart device. The Hub should be brought physically closer to the device just for the "Inclusion" process (recommended within 10ft). When finished, the Hub and device can be moved back to final installation location.

1. Go to the "Add Device" page.
2. Select "Include Device".
3. When prompted, press the "ON" or "OFF" Button on the switch

### Exclusion Information

1. From the Control Panel, go the the device Exclusion page.
2. Select "Exclude Device".
3. When prompted, press the "ON" or "OFF" Button on the switch.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW15SM -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW15SM supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Send device reset locally notification
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: StatusReport

Send basic report
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: PowerReport

Send meter power report
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: AssignGroupSet

Send Basic set command
This group supports 5 nodes.
