# ZW15SM Binary Switch + Meter
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZW15SM*, manufactured by *Wenzhou MTLC Electric Appliances Co.,Ltd.* with the thing type UID of ```enerwave_zw15sm_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZW15SM supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The on/off switch replaces your current light switch, uses your existing wiring, and provides in-wall control of overhead lighting and remote access.

### Inclusion Information

The process of "Inclusion/ Exclusion" is to Add or Remove the device from the Hub. All Z-Wave devices must be "Included" on the Controller (Hub) before it can be controlled from a smart device. The Hub should be brought physically closer to the device just for the "Inclusion" process (recommended within 10ft). When finished, the Hub and device can be moved back to final installation location. 

  1. Go to the "Add Device" page.
  2. Select "Include Device".
  3. When prompted, press the "ON" or "OFF" Button on the switch

### Exclusion Information

  1. From the Control Panel, go the the device Exclusion page.
  2. Select "Exclude Device".
  3. When prompted, press the "ON" or "OFF" Button on the switch.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW15SM -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW15SM supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Send device reset locally notification

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: StatusReport

Send basic report

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: PowerReport

Send meter power report

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: AssignGroupSet

Send Basic set command

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
