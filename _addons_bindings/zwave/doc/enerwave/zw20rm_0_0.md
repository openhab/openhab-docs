# ZW20RM In-wall Smart Meter Duplex Receptacle
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZW20RM*, manufactured by *Wenzhou MTLC Electric Appliances Co.,Ltd.* with the thing type UID of ```enerwave_zw20rm_00_000```.

The ZW20RM supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/383) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW20RM -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Sensor (power) | sensor_power | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Sensor (power)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```sensor_power``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW20RM supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Notifications

Lifeline
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: StatusReport

Send basic report
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: PowerReport

Send meter power report
This group supports 5 nodes.
