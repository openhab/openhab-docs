The ZW20RM supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ZW20RM TR Duplex Receptacle is a perfect wireless manual and remote on/off control replacement of regular receptacles, controlling table and floor lamps, small appliances, etc. This ZW20RM TR Duplex Receptacle provides two different type outlets. One outlet with Z-Wave mark has programmable functions such as scenes, association, schedule event, etc. It can be added to most Z-Wave compliant controllers, and a Blue LED on the face cover indicates the status of the controlled outlet and acts as a night light. The other outlet with Tamper-Resistant feature provides constant power, helps you and your families prevent electrical injuries.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW20RM supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Notifications

Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: StatusReport

Send basic report

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: PowerReport

Send meter power report

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
