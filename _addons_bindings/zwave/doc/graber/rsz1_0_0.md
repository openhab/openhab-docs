The RSZ1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The Graber/Bali two-button remote allows up/down/stop control over a single shade or group of shades and acts as a secondary controller/remote.

### Inclusion Information

To operate as a secondary controller on a Z-Wave network, the following steps must be performed in order:

  1.  Reset the remote (unassociate it from the blind/shade)
  2.  Include the blind/shade to the Z-Wave network
  3.  Include the remote in the Z-Wave network
  4. Associate the remote to the blind/shade

**Reset the remote**

Press and hold the programming button on the back of the remote until the LEDs stop flashing.  LEDs will flash green, amber, red, and then finally turn off (about 15 seconds).

**Include the blind/shade in the Z-Wave network**

Follow the manufacturer's directions for inclusion of the blind/shade.

**Include the remote in the Z-Wave network**

Put the primary controller in inclusion mode.  Press and hold the programming button on the back of the remote until the LEDs start flashing green (3-4 seconds).

**Associate the remote to the blind/shade**

Press and release the programming button on the back of the remote once.  The LEDs will flash green. Set the headrail of the blind/shade to associate a remote (typically holding the programming button on the headrail for 3 seconds until the LEDs flash green).  The remote should be associated with the blind/shade and the primary controller will allow the remote to act as secondary controller for the blind/shade.

### Exclusion Information

For exclusion, the remote must be reset and the remote node must be deleted manually from the primary controller.  To reset the remote, press and hold the programming button on the back of the remote until the LEDs stop flashing.  LEDs will flash green, amber, red, and then finally turn off (about 15 seconds).

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the RSZ1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Rollershutter | blinds_control | blinds_control | Blinds | Rollershutter | 
| Dimmer  [Deprecated]| switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Rollershutter
UP, DOWN, STOP

Provides start / stop control of blinds.

The ```blinds_control``` channel is of type ```blinds_control``` and supports the ```Rollershutter``` item and is in the ```Blinds``` category.

### Dimmer [Deprecated]
0-100

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

**Note:** This channel is marked as deprecated so should not be used.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RSZ1 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline (primary controller)
SWITCH MULTILEVEL REPORT after movement  
BATTERY STATUS after movement or critical status  
DEVICE RESET LOCALLY

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
