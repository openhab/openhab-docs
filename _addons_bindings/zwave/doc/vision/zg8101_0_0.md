# ZG8101 Garage Door Tilt Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZG8101*, manufactured by *[Vision Security](http://www.visionsecurity.com.tw/)* with the thing type UID of ```vision_zg8101_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Garage Door*, defining Garage Door.

The ZG8101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZG8101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This sensor offers information whether a garage door is open or closed. It detect the horizontally or vertical position of the door. It is therefore required to mount it to the door in a way that it will also change the position from vertically to horizontally and back. The installation can be done with screws or double-sided tape. The device is battery-operated and therefore in sleeping mode unless an action is detected. After a programmable sleeping time the device wakes up and sends a status information. After this the unit goes back to sleeping modus. Batteries can be changed without unscrewing the device from the door or frame. The unit will give a visual warning on the device and sends a warning to the Z-Wave controller, when batteries need to be replaced. The units send information to a controller or any other associated Z-Wave device. Up to 5 devices can be controlled from this device. Two terminals allows the connection of an external dry contact in parallel to the position sensor. The powerful CR123 Lithium battery lasts 3 ... 5 years in normal operation conditions. The device supports normal Z-Wave inclusion, auto inclusion and network wide inclusion for convenient handling.

### Inclusion Information

On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called Inclusion. 

A single click for one second on the tampering switch inside the enclosure will confirm Inclusion and Exclusion.

### Exclusion Information

Devices can also leave a network. This process is called Exclusion. Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default. If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network. Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset first.

### Wakeup Information

The ZG8101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time. Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller C is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store commands that can not be received during deep sleep state. Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. (c) 2016 Z-Wave Europe GmbH, Antonstr. 3, 09337 Hohenstein-Ernstthal, Germany, All rights reserved, www.zwaveeurope.com - pp 3 This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification. The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal battery life time and the desired responses of the device. Releasing the tampering switch will wake up the device and keep it awake   

### General Usage Information

The installed tilt sensor will send out a wireless signal every time the garage door is changing its position from open to close or back.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZG8101 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (door) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (tamper) | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (door)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (tamper)
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZG8101 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Control Command


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
