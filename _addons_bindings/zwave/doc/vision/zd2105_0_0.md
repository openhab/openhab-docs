The ZD2105 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZD2105 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

### Inclusion Information

For “Inclusion” in (adding to) a network: Put the Z-WaveTM Interface Controller into “inclusion” mode, and following its instruction to add the ZD2105 to your controller. To get in the “inclusion” mode, please press the Program Switch of ZD2105 for sending the NIF. After sending NIF, Z-Wave will send the auto inclusion; otherwise, ZD2105 will go to sleep after 20 seconds

### Exclusion Information

For “Exclusion” from (removing from) a network: Put the Z-WaveTM Interface Controller into “exclusion” mode, and following its instruction to delete the ZD2105 from your controller. Press the Program Switch of ZD2105 for 1 second at least to be excluded.

Note: All user and network settings will be cleared and the device reset to factory

### Wakeup Information

The ZD2105 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Awake Mode:

It will be triggering after opening the cover, also the red LED will keep on lasting 10 seconds and ZD2105 will send “Wake Up Notification” after 10 seconds. If ZD2105 received “Wake Up No More Information” command then the red LED will go off or it will wait 10 seconds then go off. It will proceed all the commands after sending the “Wake Up Notification”

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZD2105 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door status | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door status
changed to sensor_door for OPEN/CLOSED

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZD2105 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Control Command


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
