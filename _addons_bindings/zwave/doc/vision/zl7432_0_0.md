The ZL7432 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

## Turn on or turn off two individual appliances that attached to ZL7432 by Z-Wave™ Interface Controller

## CONTROL 2 SWITCHES AT A TIME!

Super Mini Size: 1.25 x 1.5 x 0.85 in

2 Relay Control

Works with incandescent lighting and resistive loads

### Inclusion Information

For “Inclusion” in (adding to) a network: Put the Z-Wave™ Interface Controller into “inclusion” mode, and following its instruction to add the ZL 7432 to your controller. To get in the “inclusion” mode, the distance between module and controller is suggested to be in one meter. Turn on and turn off the wall switch that connects with ZL 7432 module 4 times to be included. (or press the Program SW 4 times within 2 seconds to be included)

### Exclusion Information

For “Exclusion” from (removing from) a network: Put the Z-Wave™ Interface Controller into “exclusion” mode, and following its instruction to delete the ZL 7432 from your controller. Turn on and turn off the wall switch that connects with ZL 7432 module 4 times to be excluded. (or press the Program SW 4 times within 2 seconds to be excluded)

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZL7432 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Update Controller


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
