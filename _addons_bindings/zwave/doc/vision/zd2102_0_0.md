The ZD2102 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZD2102 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ZD2102 Door and Window sensor is used in any Z-Wave network to detect the opening or closing of a door or window. Special Design can fit most of door/window frame. The primary sensing element is a magnetic reed switch, the ZD2102 is supplied with the sensor, sensor mounting bracket and the trigger magnet. An additional set of sensor inputs are provided through a 2 position screw terminal and can be used to expand the sensor capability to multiple inputs. The ZD2102 is powered by a single CR123A Lithium Battery (supplied with unit, battery life is more than 5 years) and is intended for indoor use only. The ZD2102 features tamper proof switch, low battery warning and can be firmware updated over the air.

### Inclusion Information

Press the program switch

### Exclusion Information

Press the program switch for at least 1 second

### Wakeup Information

The ZD2102 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZD2102 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (Binary) | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (Alarm) | alarm_entry | alarm_entry | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (Binary)
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Tamper Alarm
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Sensor (Alarm)
Indicates if the entry alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_entry``` channel is of type ```alarm_entry``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Open |
| OFF | Closed |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZD2102 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Control Command


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
