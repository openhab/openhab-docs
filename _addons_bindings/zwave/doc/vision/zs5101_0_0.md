# ZS5101 Shock Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZS5101*, manufactured by *[Vision Security](http://www.visionsecurity.com.tw/)* with the thing type UID of ```vision_zs5101_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The ZS5101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZS5101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

ZS5101 detects the vibrations made by an intruder trying to break a window or door, and also detect tamper situations, it will send Z-Wave signal when vibrations or tamper situations are detected. 

### Inclusion Information

For "Inclusion" in (adding to) a network: Put the Z-Wave Interface Controller into "inclusion" mode, and following its instruction to add the ZS5101 to your controller.  To get in the "inclusion" mode, the distance between sensor and controller is suggested to be in one meter.  Press the program/tamper switch of ZS5101 for 1 second at least to be included. The LED on the ZS5101 should go off, if not, please try again

### Exclusion Information

For "Exclusion" from (removing from) a network: Put the Z-Wave Interface Controller into "exclusion" mode, and following its instruction to delete the ZS5101 from your controller.  Press the program/tamper switch of ZS5101 for 1 second at least to be excluded.  

### Wakeup Information

The ZS5101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


"Awake" mode: it is to leave the "Sleep" mode by removing the cover of ZS5101, to allow the Z-Wave Interface Controller to do "Inclusion", "Exclusion", "Association" and to reply and receive the commands from controller. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZS5101 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor  [Deprecated]| sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Shock Alarm | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor [Deprecated]
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

**Note:** This channel is marked as deprecated so should not be used.

### Shock Alarm
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Tamper Alarm
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZS5101 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
