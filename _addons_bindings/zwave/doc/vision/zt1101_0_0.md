The ZT1101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Portable Controller with Remote Control Keyfob:

  * Micro USB Charge (5V)
  * Lithium Rechargeable Battery (280mAH)
  * Setting Mode (Inclusion/Exclusion/Association/Learning/Shift)
  * Control Mode (Arm/Disarm, On/Off Control)

### Inclusion Information

To “Include” into (adding into) an existing network: Put the Z-Wave™ Gateway or Controller into learn mode to add the keyfob into your controller. To get in to “inclusion” mode, the distance between sensor and controller is suggested to be within one meter.

Under Control Mode: press button 1 and 4 together till the red LED flashes

Under Setup Mode: press button 3 and 4 together till the red LED flashes

### Exclusion Information

To “Exclude” from (removing from) an existing network: Put the Z-Wave™ Gateway or Controller into learn mode to remove the keyfob into/from your controller. To get in to “exclusion” mode, the distance between sensor and controller is suggested to be within one meter.

Under Control Mode: press button 1 and 4 together till the red LED flashes

Under Setup Mode: press button 3 and 4 together till the red LED flashes

### Wakeup Information

The ZT1101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZT1101 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZT1101 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Scene Activation Set(Button 1)


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Scene Activation Set(Button 2)


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Scene Activation Set(Button 3)


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Scene Activation Set(Button 4)


Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
