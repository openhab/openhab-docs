The ZSE40 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE40 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * 4 smart sensors in 1 compact device
  * 7 levels of motion sensitivity to choose from
  * 3 modes for motion / temp led indicator notifications
  * Built-in tamper protection
  * Low battery alerts
  * Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication
  * Security enabled Z-Wave device – requires a security enabled gateway controller for full functionality

### Inclusion Information

  1. Install the batteries and bring the 4-in-1 sensor as close to your Z-Wave gateway controller as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller in inclusion/pairing mode
  3. Press and release the Z-Wave button TWICE quickly. The sensor will enter secure inclusion mode.
  4. A new 4-in-1 sensor should appear on your controller's device list

 If you are unable to include the Z-Wave sensor to your controller, please try one of the following: -

  * Bring the 4-in-1 sensor closer to your Z-Wave controller
  * Press and release the Z-Wave button quickly several times once you put the controller in the inclusion mode to ensure the command has gone through
  * Put your controller in the EXCLUSION mode and press and release the Z-Wave button, then try adding it to your network again

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the 4-in-1 sensor as close to your Z-Wave gateway controller as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller in exclusion/unpairing mode
  3. Press and release the Z-Wave button TWICE quickly
  4. The device should disappear from your controller's device list.

The led indicator will flash 3 times when you take the batteries out and put them back in to indicate the device has been successfully excluded. Please repeat the process following all steps carefully if the led indicator blinks only once when you reinsert the batteries.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE40 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Use the Wake Up command to set wake-up interval for the sensor (from 10 minutes to 1 week) to report back to the controller. You can also press and release the Z-Wave button once to wake up the device manually.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE40 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (motion) | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | sensor_luminance |  | Number | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Motion Alarm | alarm_motion | alarm_motion | Motion | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (motion)
This does not appear to be used, but the original authors of this device added it and I cannot figure out how to delete an item.

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Motion Alarm
Motion PIR Sensor - Event 8 is motion; Event 3 is motion + tamper; Event 0 is clear.

Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

### Parameter 4: Light Sensor

Configure Light Sensor

Values in the range 1 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Trigger Interval

Set the trigger interval for motion sensor re-activation.

Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (Flashing Temperature and Motion).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE40 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Receive updates

Receive sensor updates

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
