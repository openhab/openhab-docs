The CT80 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The CT80 programmable communicating thermostat operates via a high-quality, easy-to-use touch screen. To program or adjust your CT80, simply touch your finger firmly to the screen. The screen will automatically light up. The screen will respond differently to different types of touches, so you may want to experiment with your finger or a stylus (not included), to see what works best for you. The “beep” sound is heard when the CT80 senses a valid touch of the screen.

### Inclusion Information

Push Menu button, choose network, choose Z-Wave Radio, push "Mate" (only usable with Z-Wave Module)

### Exclusion Information

# Factory Default Restore

Performing a Factory Default Restore will return your thermostat to the state it was in when it left the factory. This means that all of its configuration and parameters will be returned to their default values. This includes resetting its Z-Wave network information, removing it from its previous network. This action should only be used in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. To perform this action, the thermostat must be switch to OFF mode. Wait until the radio wave icons on the left side of the screen stop blinking then touch the screen once to turn on the back light and then hold the center of the screen for about 8 seconds until the thermostat beeps.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CT80 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

This device support one association group, and up to two nodes in that group. If at least one node is added to association group one (1), the thermostat will send the following association reports when the respective state has changed:

• Thermostat Mode Report

• Thermostat Operating State Report

• Fan Mode Report

• Fan State Report

• Setpoint Report (for all supported setpoints)

• Sensor Multilevel Report (if enabled by Configuration Command Class)

The association command class can be configured to send encapsulated reports via the Multi Instance Command Class or the Multi Channel Command Class. If the association configuration commands are sent inside encapsulated commands, the thermostat will respond with encapsulated reports of the same type (Multi Instance v1 or Multi Channel v3). Encapsulation is the only way to configure the thermostat to send humidity sensor multilevel association reports.

For example, if an Association Set is encapsulated in a Multi Channel Command Encapsulation command is sent to the humidity instance (2), then the thermostat will encapsulate all un-solicited humidity sensor multilevel reports in the Multi Channel Command Encapsulation Command. The default instance is the temperature instance (1). If the Association Set is sent un-encapsulated then the thermostat will send all un-solicited temperature sensor multilevel reports unencapsulated.

All association reports other than the humidity multilevel are in the default instance (1). The thermostat will encapsulate the association reports based on the last Association Set encapsulation type received (i.e. un-encapsulated, Multi Instance v1, or Multi Channel V3).

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
