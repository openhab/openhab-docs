| 7 | 	Thermostat Swing Temperature | Variance allowed from setpoint |
| 9 | Thermostat Recovery Mode | Fast or Economy recovery mode. |

### Parameter 1: Temperature Reporting Threshold

Reporting threshold for changes in the ambient temperature.
This value determines the reporting threshold when association reporting is enabled. Unsupported values will be ignored.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

| 1 | 0.5° |
| 2 | 1.0° |
| 3 | 1.5° |
| 4 | 2.0° |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (1.0°).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Utility Lock Enable/Disable

Prevents setpoint changes at thermostat.
If set to 0, the utility lock is disabled, all other values, 1-255, will enable the utility lock.  This will prevent changes to the setpoint at the thermostat screen.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Utility lock disabled |
| 1 | Utility lock enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Utility lock disabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: 	Thermostat Swing Temperature

Variance allowed from setpoint
The thermostat swing temperature is in units of 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit. A value of 0x01 is 0.05F and 0x02 is 1.0F. The supported values may vary from thermostat to thermostat but typically the allowed values are 0.5F (0x01) to 4.0F (0x08).

The Thermostat Swing Temperature configuration command sets swing temperature on the thermostat setpoint.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 0.5° |
| 2 | 1.0° |
| 3 | 1.5° |
| 4 | 2.0° |
| 5 | 2.5° |
| 6 | 3.0° |
| 7 | 3.5° |
| 8 | 4.0° |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (1.0°).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Thermostat Recovery Mode

Fast or Economy recovery mode.
The Thermostat Recovery Mode can be either fast (0x01) or economy (0x02).
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Fast recovery Mode |
| 2 | Economy recovery Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (Economy recovery Mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CT101 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
