The CT100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The CT100 communicating Z-Wave thermostat operates via a high-quality, easy-to-use touch screen. To set or adjust your CT100, simply touch your finger firmly to the screen.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Press and release the MENU button on the thermostat.
  2. Press the MATE button - This will bring you to the network screen and a large r1 will be displayed.
  3. Press the MATE button, this will initiate the mating process. When a device has joined a network the word LINK will appear under the radio tower.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Press and release the MENU button on the thermostat.
  2. Press the MATE button - This will bring you to the network screen and a large r1 will be displayed.
  3. Press the MATE button, this will initiate the mating process. When a device been removed from a network the word LINK below the radio tower will disappear.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat mode
Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel is of type ```thermostat_mode``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |

### Operating State
Sets the thermostat operating state.

The ```thermostat_state``` channel is of type ```thermostat_state``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Idle |
| 1 | Heating |
| 2 | Cooling |
| 3 | Fan Only |
| 4 | Pending Heat |
| 5 | Pending Cool |
| 6 | Vent / Economiser |

### Setpoint (heating)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Setpoint (cooling)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Thermostat fan mode
Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Thermostat fan state
Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Time Offset
Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel is of type ```time_offset``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (temperature) 1
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature1``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Relative Humidity
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity2``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The CT100 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

Send report about Thermostat Mode, Thermostat Operating State, Fan Mode, Fan State, Setpoint, Sensor Multilevel

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
