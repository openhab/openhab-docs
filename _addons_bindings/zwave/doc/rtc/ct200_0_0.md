# CT200 Vivint Element Thermostat w/ other sensors
This describes the Z-Wave device *CT200*, manufactured by *Radio Thermostat Company of America (RTC)* with the thing type UID of ```rtc_ct200_00_000```.

The CT200 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

### Inclusion Information

The Vivint Element Thermostat is a Z-Wave® compliant thermostat. It has an onboard radio that can be added to an existing Z-Wave® network. This device can be used on a network with products from different vendors.

1. Set your primary controller to INCLUDE mode to add the thermostat as a node on your network (see your specific controller’s User Manual for detailed instructions).
2. The Thermostat main screen shows a welcome message. Press the SIDE button to continue.
3. Press the SIDE button to initiate the inclusion process. This initiates the network connection process. 
  - If inclusion fails, the screen says “Failed”. Press the SIDE button to try adding again.
4. When the Thermostat has been successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the screen displays a confirmation check mark. Press the SIDE button to continue. You can now configure the thermostat to work with your HVAC system.
5. Your primary controller indicates that the thermostat was successfully added to its network (see your specific controller’s User Manual for details).

### Exclusion Information

The Vivint Element can be excluded from the Z-Wave network process similar to the inclusion process. Set your primary controller to EXCLUDE.

### Wakeup Information

When your thermostat is running on battery power, the Z-Wave radio will turn off to help conserve battery life. The Thermostat Z-Wave radio module supports Z-Wave beaming, which allows other devices in the network to wake up the Z-Wave module and accept commands and then go back to sleep.

When your thermostat is running on C-Wire power, the Z-Wave radio will stay on and actively help route messages within the Z-Wave network. The thermostat’s node type is fixed when it is included to the Z-Wave network; if the C-Wire is present and powered when including to the network, the thermostat will remain an alwayslistening node until it is removed from the network.
