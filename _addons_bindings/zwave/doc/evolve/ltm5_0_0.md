The LTM-5 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The 3-Way Wall Mounted Switch (LTM-5) is the Evolve in-wall accessory switch, used for creating virtual 3-way and 4-way circuits, as well as wirelessly controlling Evolve lighting devices and plug-in modules.  The LTM-5 does not directly control a load. Instead, it communicates with other load controlling devices or plug-in modules.   
   
There is a small LED on the device, which remains illuminated and flickers when sending a command to another Evolve device.
