The 11 02 011 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 11 02 011 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Strips, the ultra-thin multi sensor is now available in two new sensor models, Strips Drip and Strips Comfort. Drip and Comfort join Strips Guard, the thinnest magnet sensor in the world detecting if your windows are open and closed invisibly since 2015. Strip Drip sends an alarm signal if it detects a water leak. Its unique design allows it to be easily placed almost everywhere, including most places other sensors simply can’t fit. With soaking pads integrated in the mounting plate even small amounts of water will be detected. The built-in temperature sensor gives the possibility to combine the leakage alarm with a freeze alarm. There is also a built-in ambient light sensor that may be useful in special applications. Strips Comfort is a very accurate temperature and ambient light sensor. The unique design and mounting plate makes it easy to place almost invisibly in your home to measure temperature or control heating, air conditioning and even windows blinds which are connected to your Z-Wave smart home system. All Strips products can be used both in-doors and out-doors and the integrated custom battery gives Strips an expected lifetime of up to 10 years. For you, this means no hassle needing to change or charge batteries in your Strips sensors for the lifetime of the products!

You may need to reset Strips if your Z-Wave controller is missing or not responding. Follow the instructions for “Wake up”, but on the 3rd repetition, leave the magnet at the rounded edge for 10 seconds. A long LED signal indicates success.

### Inclusion Information

Set your controller to add mode (see your controller’s manual). Follow the instruction for Wake up. A long LED blink indicates that the add/remove was successful.

### Exclusion Information

Set your controller to remove mode (see your controller’s manual). Follow the instruction for Wake up. A long LED blink indicates that the add/remove was successful.

### Wakeup Information

The 11 02 011 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Wake up Strips manually for Z-Wave communication. Place the magnet at the rounded edge. When the LED blinks, move the magnet away. Repeat twice within 10 seconds.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 11 02 011 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.
