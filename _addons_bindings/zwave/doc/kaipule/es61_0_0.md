# ES-61 Smoke Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *ES-61*, manufactured by *Kaipule Technology Co., Ltd.* with the thing type UID of ```kaipule_es61_00_000```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions below 5.255

The device is in the category of *Smoke Detector*, defining Smoke detectors.

The ES-61 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ES-61 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

ES61 is a battery powered independent photoelectric smoke sensor, mainly used for detecting surrounding smoke concentration. It will make loud audio alert when the concentration exceeds its alarm threshold, and send alarm signal to Control Panel at the same time.

Restore Factory Settings - press the anti-tamper switch for 6 times within 2.5 seconds to restore factory settings.

### Inclusion Information

Enter the Inclusion Mode of the gateway, and press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5s, then the Smoke Sensor will stay in enrolment state until successfully enrolled into network enrolment time out after 30s.

### Exclusion Information

Enter the Exclusion Mode of the gateway, and press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5s, then the Smoke Sensor will be removed after period of time.

### Wakeup Information

The ES-61 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

a) Manual Wake-up - Quickly press tamper switch once, the Smoke Sensor will automatically send wake-up information, and there will be 10s after wake-up to receive gateway setting information.

b) Automatic Wake-up - Default time of automatic wake-up is 24 hours, and there will be 10s after wake-up to receive gateway setting information. The max automatic report time = 24 hours, minimum = 30 min.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ES-61 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (smoke) | alarm_smoke | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (tamper) | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (smoke)

Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (tamper)

Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ES-61.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set | send BASIC Set = Value command |
| 2 | Turn Off Light Time Configuration | send BASIC Set = Value command & send Basic Set = 0x00 to turn of light |
| 3 | PIR Sensor Alarm Elemination Time Configuration | Value \* 5s |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set

send BASIC Set = Value command
If there is any device in Association Group 2 the PIR Sensor will send BASIC Set = Value command to control that deivce when the PIR is triggered.
Values in the range 1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Turn Off Light Time Configuration

send BASIC Set = Value command & send Basic Set = 0x00 to turn of light
If there is any device in Association Group 2 the PIR Sensor will send BASIC Set = Value command to Group 2 and send Basic Set = 0x00 to turn of light after 5 x t seconds- Set value t means to send the BAsic Set command after t seconds.
Values in the range 1 to 120 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: PIR Sensor Alarm Elemination Time Configuration

Value \* 5s
Min time is 5s. Eg If the config is 1, this means it will eliminate alarm after 1 \* 5s = 5 seconds
Values in the range 1 to 120 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ES-61 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Send "notification\_Report" to the device in Life line group
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set Command


This group supports 5 nodes.
