The  DP-32 / IX-30 / IX-32 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The  DP-32 / IX-30 / IX-32 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The hardware board for the IX30 (wall) and IX32 (ceiling) is the same thing and reports the same Type and ID.

### Inclusion Information

Enter the Inclusion Mode of gateway, and press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5s, then the PIR sensor will stay in enrollment state until successfully enrolled into network or enrollment time out after 30s.

### Exclusion Information

Enter the Exclusion Mode of gateway, and press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5s, then the PIR sensor will be removed after a period of time.

### Wakeup Information

The  DP-32 / IX-30 / IX-32 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Quickly press tamper switch once, the PIR sensor will automatically send wake-up information, and there will be 10s after wake-up to receive gateway setting information.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the  DP-32 / IX-30 / IX-32 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Motion Alarm | alarm_motion | alarm_motion | Motion | Switch | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Motion Alarm
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Tamper Alarm
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the  DP-32 / IX-30 / IX-32.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set | Basic Set |
| 2 | Turn Off Light Time Configuration | Turn Off Light Time Configuration |
| 3 | PIR Sensor Alarm Elimination Time Configuration | PIR Sensor Alarm Elimination Time Configuration |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set

Basic Set
If there is any device in Association Group 2 the PIR Sensor will send BASIC Set = Value command to control that deivce when the PIR is triggered.
Values in the range 1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Turn Off Light Time Configuration

Turn Off Light Time Configuration
If there is any device in Association Group 2 the PIR Sensor will send BASIC Set = Value command to Group 2 and send Basic Set = 0x00 to turn of light after 5 x t seconds- Set value t means to send the BAsic Set command after t seconds.
Values in the range 1 to 120 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: PIR Sensor Alarm Elimination Time Configuration

PIR Sensor Alarm Elimination Time Configuration
Min time is 5s. Eg If the config is 1, this means it will eliminate alarm after 1 * 5s = 5 seconds

The selected value is multiplied with 5. After this time the sensor will report PIR OFF.

E.g. If you select value --> 3 * 5s = 15 seconds.

The Sensor will report PIR Off after 15 seconds.
Values in the range 1 to 120 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The  DP-32 / IX-30 / IX-32 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Send "notification_Report" to the device in Life line group

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set Command

When sensor is triggered:

[Command Class BAsic, Basic Set, Value = 0xFF(default 0xFF, configurable, see Config Parameters)

When light up timeout:

[Command Class BAsic, BAsic Set, Value =0x00]

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
