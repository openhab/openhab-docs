# PIR Motion Sensor Motion Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *PIR Motion Sensor*, manufactured by *Ring* with the thing type UID of ```ring_1156d_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The PIR Motion Sensor supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PIR Motion Sensor does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Ring Alarm Motion Sensor: Expand your Ring Alarm system to secure each room in your home, and get alerts as soon as they detect motion.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Activate inclusion mode on controller
  2. Pull tab/quickly disconnect and reconnect battery
  3. Device should appear in Inbox

### Exclusion Information

  1. Initiate exclusion mode on controller
  2. Open contact sensor’s cover Remove and replace battery quickly

Reset:

  1. Press and hold the reset button found under the pinhole on the back of the device.
  2. The LED of the sensor should begin blinking. Hold the  button down until the blinking stops
  3. Remove the cover from your motion sensor.
  4. Remove the battery.
  5. Place the battery back in the device.
  6. Put the cover back on the device. 

### Wakeup Information

The PIR Motion Sensor does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


By opening the cover, the sensor will get to tamper state and stay awake.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PIR Motion Sensor -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the PIR Motion Sensor.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Dwell Time | Dwell Time |
| 3 | Pet Immunity | Pet Immunity |
| 4 | Walk Test | Walk Test |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 2: Dwell Time

Dwell Time
Configures the “dwell” window or how long the sensor should not be detecting motion before sending the “no motion detected” message. 

1 to 9 minutes.
Values in the range 1 to 9 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Pet Immunity

Pet Immunity
Configures the “Pet Immunity,” or sensitivity of the motion detection used mostly so only human motion is detected.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No pet immunity |
| 1 | 15kg (33lb) |
| 2 | 25kg (55lb) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (25kg (55lb)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Walk Test

Walk Test
Parameter 4 is used to activate a “walk test” mode to test the PIR motion detection coverage after being installed.

This mode is active for 15 minutes only after which the sensor returns to normal operation.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Normal operation |
| 255 | Activate Walk Test for 15 minutes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Normal operation).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PIR Motion Sensor supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Controller Updates

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Report

Basic Report
Basic Report

Association group 2 supports 1 node.
