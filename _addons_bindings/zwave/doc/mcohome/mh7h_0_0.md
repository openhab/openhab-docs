### Inclusion Information

In normal working interface, press and hold S4 to enter interface for inclusion or exclusion of Z-Wave network. Before device included into network, “- - -” will display on the screen. Then press S4 once, device will enter learning mode to get a node ID. If inclusion is success, a node ID will display on the screen in a few seconds.

After inclusion, turn off the device and then turn it on. Now the device is ready to be operated by controller/ gateway in Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

In normal working interface, press and hold S4 to enter interface for inclusion or exclusion of Z-Wave network. Before device included into network, “- - -” will display on the screen. Then press S4 once, device will enter learning mode to get a node ID. If inclusion is success, a node ID will display on the screen in a few seconds.
