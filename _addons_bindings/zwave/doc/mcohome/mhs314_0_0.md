The MH-S314 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Touch Panel Switch is a wall switch with built-in Z-Wave module. It supports basic command class，multi channel command class and multi channel association command class, which can control all associated devices synchronously. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from any other manufacturers.

### Inclusion Information

Press and hold any key on the panel for 8 seconds. If inclusion is successful, all INDICATION LEDs on the panel will turn green, and all switches will turn on.

### Exclusion Information

Press and hold any key on the panel for 8 seconds. If the exclusion is successful, all INDICATION LEDs on the panel will turn orange, and all switches will turn off. The exclusion will delete all association data.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH-S314 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Switch Button Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Switch Button Group 2


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch Button Group 3


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Switch Button Group 4


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: All Status Reports


This group supports 1 nodes.
