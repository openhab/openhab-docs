The MH-S512-IL does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Touch Panel Switch is a wall panel built-in with Z-Wave Plus module. With its stylish design and stable performance, the panel can be used to control house-hold electrical appliances like lamp, motor, coffee machine, TV set etc. It supports basic command class，multi channel command class and multi channel association command class, also works as a repeater in a Z-Wave network. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from any other manufacturers.

### Inclusion Information

INCLUDING the device into Z-Wave network:

  1. Set controller into INCLUSION mode. Follow instructions provided by controller manufacturer.
  2. Press and hold any key on the panel for 8 seconds or 3 clicks in quick succession.

Note: If inclusion is successful, all INDICATION LEDs on the panel will flash 4 times. 

### Exclusion Information

EXCLUDING the device from Z-Wave network:

  1. Set controller into EXCLUSION mode. Follow instructions provided by controller manufacturer.
  2. Press and hold any key on the panel for 8 seconds or 3 clicks in quick succession.

Note: If the exclusion is successful, all INDICATION LEDs on the panel will flash 4 times. The exclusion will delete all association data.

### Wakeup Information

The MH-S512-IL does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH-S512-IL supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set Commands Sw 1


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic Set Commands Sw 2


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
