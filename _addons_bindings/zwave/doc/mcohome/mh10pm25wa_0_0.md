The MH10-PM2.5-WA supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MCOHome PM2.5 Monitor is an air quality detector which compatible with Z-Wave Plus technology, it is mainly used to monitor PM2.5 concentration in industrial, agricultural, and residence environment, while monitoring the indoor temperature and humidity. Device can be included into any Z-Wave network, and is compatible with any other Z-Wave certified devices.

### Inclusion Information

The unlabelled buttons on the left edge of the device are S1, S2 and S3, starting from the top.

Activate Inclusion/Exclusion mode in your Z-Wave controller.

With the device powered on, long press S1 & S3 simultaneously to enter Inclusion/Exclusion mode.

  * If device is not included into a Z-Wave network before, “\- - -” will display on the screen.
  * Then press S1 once, “\- - -” will flash and the device enters into learning mode to get a node ID.

If inclusion is successful, a node ID will display on the screen. If not, “\- - -” will stop flashing after 20 seconds.

Note: If display is flashing, you can abort the operation by long pressing S1+S3. If display is not flashing, press S2 once to return to normal operation.

### Exclusion Information

The unlabelled buttons on the left edge of the device are S1, S2 and S3, starting from the top.

Activate Inclusion/Exclusion mode in your Z-Wave controller.

With the device powered on, long press S1 & S3 simultaneously to enter Inclusion/Exclusion mode.

  * If a node ID is displayed, it means the device is already in a Z-Wave network.
  * Press S1 once can remove it from the network. “\- - -” displays.
  * Press S2 once can return to normal work

Note: If display is flashing, you can abort the operation by long pressing S1+S3. If display is not flashing, press S2 once to return to normal operation.

### General Usage Information

Installation & Wiring

Location:  
Device is suggested to be installed indoor, a place with around 1.5m height above the floor where represents the average PM2.5 concentration. It should be away from direct sunlight, any cover, or any heat source, to avoid false signal for detection.  
  
Notice!  
Device must be wall-mounted vertically. Do not lay it flat or upside down while working.  
Do not mounted it in a wind gap, or cover its bottom, which may affect the detected data.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the MH10-PM2.5-WA -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Sensor (particulate) | sensor_particulate | sensor_particulate |  | Number | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (particulate)
PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair.

Commonly written as PM<sub>2.5</sub>, particles in this category are so small that they can only be detected with an electron microscope. They are even smaller than their counterparts PM<sub>10</sub>, which are particles that are 10 micrometres or less, and are also called **fine particles**.

Since they are so small and light, fine particles tend to stay longer in the air than heavier particles. This increases the chances of humans and animals inhaling them into the bodies. Owing to their minute size, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers are able to bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system.

Studies have found a close link between exposure to fine particles and premature death from heart and lung disease. Fine particles are also known to trigger or worsen chronic disease such as asthma, heart attack, bronchitis and other respiratory problems.

Source

Indicates the level of particulate matter.

The ```sensor_particulate``` channel is of type ```sensor_particulate``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH10-PM2.5-WA supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
