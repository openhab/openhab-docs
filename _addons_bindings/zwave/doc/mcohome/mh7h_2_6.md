## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH7H supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
For sending temperature, working mode, etc. notifications
Thermostat supports 1 association group. A gateway is suggested to associate with this group.

Then if any changes happen, such as: temperature, working mode, etc., the thermostat will report to this associated device (gateway).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set 1

Send “Basic_Set” command to the associated devices when any relay status change of the thermostat happens.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic Set 2

Send “Basic_Set” command to the associated devices when any relay status change of the thermostat happens.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
