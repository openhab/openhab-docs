## Overview

Specifications

  * The EV100 Z-Vent requires 2x AAA batteries (not included with the unit). The batteries must be equal (both equally new or equally worn). Two new, good quality alkaline AAA batteries should last for over a year with an average use of 2 operations a day. For best results and extended operation time (over 2 years of normal use), use Lithium AAA batteries.
  * The EV100 Z-Vent can be paired with, and controlled using, any Z-Wave compatible controller. 

### Inclusion Information

Press the SET button 3 or more times rapidly (within 1.5 seconds). This will pair the Z-Vent with your Z-Wave controller

### Exclusion Information

Press the SET button 3 or more times rapidly (within 1.5 seconds). This will clear the Z-Vent’s memory of any previous pairings

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the EV100 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
