The ZSD-109 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Nexa ZSD-109 fire alarm is designed to sense smoke particles. It has a built-in temperature sensor to provide an early warning if a fire should break out (assuming correct placement and maintenance). Principal properties is built-in temperature alarm, elevated sensitivity and stability test and pause function, LED-diode indicates normal operation and Low-battery signal.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set the Z-Wave controller to “inclusion” mode (see the controller manual)
  2. Press the Test button three times within 1.5 seconds; the LED indicator will light up.
  3. You will then hear a beep, the LED indicator will go out and the smoke alarm is now included in your Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set the Z-Wave controller to “exclusion” mode (see the controller manual).
  2. Press the Test button three times within 1.5 seconds; the LED indicator will light up.
  3. Wait for the Z-Wave controller to complete the exclusion.

### Wakeup Information

The ZSD-109 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.




### General Usage Information

To test your smoke alarm, press the Test button. The smoke alarm will respond by emitting an alarm signal. Test both before and after installation to be sure that it functions correctly. Only use the Test button to test the alarm. Never use an open flame, as this may disrupt the alarm operation.

RESTORE FACTORY SETTINGS

  1. Remove the batteries from the smoke alarm.
  2. Press the Test button and keep it depressed while re-inserting the batteries. The LED indicator lights up.
  3. Continue to keep the Test button depressed until the LED indicator turns off.
  4. Press the Test button again; you will hear a short beep to indicate that the smoke alarm has been reset.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSD-109 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (smoke) | alarm_smoke | alarm_smoke | Smoke | Switch | 
| Alarm (heat) | alarm_heat | alarm_heat | temperature_hot | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm (smoke)
Alarm for detection of smoke

Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel is of type ```alarm_smoke``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Smoke``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (heat)
Alarm for detection of heat

Indicates if a heat alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_heat``` channel is of type ```alarm_heat``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```temperature_hot``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSD-109 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.


Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: Smoke Alarm

Linkage group 2 is assigned to the devices status - sending BASIC SET control frame to the associated devices having detected the smoke alarm.

Pressing the test button or when smoke is detected it will send “BASIC SET(0xFF)” and “BASIC SET(0x00)” is sent when quit pressing the test button or smoke is cleared.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: Smoke Alarm Detection

Linkage group 3 reports the detection's status to the associated device. Smoke alarm.

Association group 3 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 4: Heat Alarm

Linkage group 4 is assigned to the devices status - sending BASIC SET control frame to the associated devices having detected the heat alarm.

Pressing the test button will send “BASIC SET(0xFF)” and “BASIC SET(0x00)” is sent when quit pressing the test button.

Association group 4 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 5: Heat Alarm Detection

Linkage group 5 reports the detection's status to the associated device.

Association group 5 supports 4 nodes.
