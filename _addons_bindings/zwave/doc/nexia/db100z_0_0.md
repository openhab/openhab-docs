# DB100Z Doorbell
This describes the Z-Wave device *DB100Z*, manufactured by *[Nexia Home Intelligence](http://www.nexiahome.com)* with the thing type UID of ```nexia_db100z_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The DB100Z supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The DB100Z does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Z-Wave Doorbell Sensor

### Inclusion Information

Press and release the INSTALL button on the DB100Z. The DB100Z LED will blink rapidly for 3 seconds when it has been included into your Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

Press and release the INSTALL button on the DB100Z. The DB100Z LED will blink rapidly for 3 seconds when it has been excluded from your Z-Wave network.

### Wakeup Information

The DB100Z does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press Install button three times rapidly.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DB100Z -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Power Management Raw | alarm_raw | alarm_raw |  | String | 
| Power Management Notification | notification_power_management | notification_power_management |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Power Management Raw
Provides alarm parameters as json string.

The ```alarm_raw``` channel is of type ```alarm_raw``` and supports the ```String``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.
This channel sets, and provides the alarm state as a JSON string. It is designed for use in rules.
### Power Management Notification
Power Management.

The ```notification_power_management``` channel is of type ```notification_power_management``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Previous events cleared |
| 1 | Power has been applied |
| 2 | AC mains disconnected |
| 3 | AC mains re-connected |
| 4 | Surge detected |
| 5 | Voltage Drop/Drift |
| 6 | Over-current detected |
| 7 | Over-voltage detected |
| 8 | Over-load detected |
| 9 | Load error |
| 10 | Replace battery soon |
| 11 | Replace battery now |
| 12 | Battery is charging |
| 13 | Battery is fully charged |
| 14 | Charge battery soon |
| 15 | Charge battery now! |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the DB100Z.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Send Battery Report with Notification Report | Send Battery Report with Notification Report |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Send Battery Report with Notification Report

Send Battery Report with Notification Report

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not send battery report |
| 1 | Send Battery Report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Do not send battery report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DB100Z supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
