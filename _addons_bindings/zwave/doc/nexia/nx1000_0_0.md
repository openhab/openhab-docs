# NX1000 Wall Controller
This describes the Z-Wave device *NX1000*, manufactured by *[Nexia Home Intelligence](http://www.nexiahome.com)* with the thing type UID of ```nexia_nx1000_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The NX1000 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The NX1000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Product Description

The Nexia One Touch is a wall controller device that can act as a central scene controller or a traditional stand-alone scene controller. The Nexia One Touch contains up to 15 different scenes organized in 3 pages of screen where each page contains 5 scenes. The Nexia One Touch conveniently runs up to 15 modes and automations with the tap of a button.

#### Safety Warning for Mains Powered Devices

ATTENTION: only authorized technicians under consideration of the country-specific installation guidelines/norms may do works with mains power. Prior to the assembly of the product, the voltage network has to be switched off and ensured against re-switching.

### Inclusion Information

  2. Press any button to wake the One Touch
  3. Press and hold the middle page button (round button) until the Installer Setup menu appears
  4. Select the 'Z-Wave' button
  5. Select the 'Include' button
  6. Include will fast flash and then SUCCESS will display briefly

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put primary controller into exclusion mode
  2. Press any button to wake the One Touch
  3. Press and hold the middle page button (round button) until the Installer Setup menu appears
  4. Select the 'Z-Wave' button5.Select the 'Exclude' button6.Exclude will fast flash and then SUCCESS will display briefly

### Wakeup Information

The NX1000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time. Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller **C** is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store commands that can not be received during deep sleep state. Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased.

This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification. The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal battery life time and the desired responses of the device. To wakeup the device please perform the following action: When the backlight and/or screen is off, the first page (round)button press will wake the One Touch causing it to send a Wakeup Notification report.

The One Touch has a 6 hour default wakeup interval and will send the Wakeup Notification once that interval expires.

WAKEUP\_INTERVAL\_CAPABILITIES_REPORT

  * Min Wake Up Interval : 4200 seconds
  * Max Wake Up Interval: 86400 seconds
  * Default Wake Up Interval: 21600 seconds
  * Wake Up Interval Step: 10

### General Usage Information

#### Reset to factory default

This device also allows to be reset without any involvement of a Z-Wave controller. This procedure should only be used when the primary controller is inoperable.

Please use Factory Reset as a last resort option only as all network settings and associations will be cleared.

  1. Press any button to wake the One Touch
  2. Press and hold the middle page button (round button) until the Installer Setup menu appears
  3. Select the 'System' button
  4. Select the 'Factory Reset' button
  5. Select 'Yes' to proceed with the factory reset

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the NX1000 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_33_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NX1000 supports 46 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
