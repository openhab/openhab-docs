The 506004 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The flush-mounted transmitter is a battery-powered radio transmitter to which you can connect up to four make contacts (e.g. push-buttons)

Line pairs are:

  * red/white-red: Input E1
  * green/white-green: Input E2
  * brown/white-brown: Input E3
  * blue/white-blue: Input E4

**Attention:** The flush-mounted transmitter can be damaged. Never connect the flush mounted transmitter to 230 V

### Inclusion Information

Triple click on operating surface of a connected switch

### Exclusion Information

Triple click on operating surface of a connected switch

### Wakeup Information

The 506004 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Triple click on operating surface of a connected switch. Wait until the LED goes out.
