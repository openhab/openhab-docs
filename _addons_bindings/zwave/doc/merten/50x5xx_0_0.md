The 50x5xx supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The roller shutter push-button contains a radio receiver for the Merten CONNECT radio system. If you use the blind control inserts 580699 or 580698, you can operate the connected roller shutter drive remotely using a Merten CONNECT radio transmitter. You can also operate the roller shutters using the rocker on the roller shutter push-button.

You can use the Merten CONNECT radio button, the Merten CONNECT radio remote control or the Merten CONNECT radio central unit as the transmitter.
