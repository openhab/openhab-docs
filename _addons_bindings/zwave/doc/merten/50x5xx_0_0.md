## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 50x5xx -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | Temperature | Number | 
| Dimmer 1 | switch_dimmer1 | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Sensor (luminance) 1 | sensor_luminance1 | Temperature | Number | 
| Dimmer 2 | switch_dimmer2 | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.
