The 507900 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The flush-mounted CONNECT radio receiver, 1-gang universal dimmer, will be referred to below as "dimmer".

The dimmer is used to switch and dim luminaires (see technical data) via radio signal and via an extension push-button connected directly to the dimmer.

The dimmer automatically recognises the connected load, is overload-proof, short-circuit-proof and hum-free, and has a soft start function which slowly dims up a connected load.
