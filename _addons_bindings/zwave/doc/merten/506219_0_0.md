The 506219 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

**Single-surface push-button:**

Top button: Association Group = 1 Parameter no. = 0

Bottom button: Association Group = 2 Parameter no. = 1

**Dual-surface push-button:**

Left top button: Association Group = 1 Parameter no. = 0

Left bottom button: Association Group = 2 Parameter no. = 1

Right top button: Association Group = 3 Parameter no. = 2

Right bottom button: Association Group = 4 Parameter no. = 3

**Transmit "Node info frame"**

Triple click on operating surface Wait until the red LED D goes out. Used to identify, associate and configure the device

### Exclusion Information

Triple click on operating surface LED flashes approx. 6 seconds. Used for include/exclude the device by the primary

### Wakeup Information

The 506219 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
