The ZTS-500 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Remotec ZTS-500 is a security Z-Wave enabled thermostat designed to control residential HVAC systems.

### Inclusion Information

Z-Wave Inclusion and Exclusion

When ZTS-500 is not in any Z-Wave network, "Z-Wave Disconnected" icon will show up on the standby menu, you can navigate to the Z-Wave from operation menu to do the inclusion. Or you can go to system settings menu, the first menu is for Z-Wave setup, you can do both inclusion and exclusion.

Tap the "+" scroll key when an inclusion or exclusion request is sent by a local Z-Wave gateway, HUB, or controller. If the procedure is successful, a "" screen will display. If the procedure fails, a "" screen will display.  
If the ZTS-500 is included in a Z-Wave network, the "Z-Wave Disconnected" icon will no longer display in the standby menu.

Note: All Z-Wave configuration parameter values will keep no changes after excluding the unit from the network, except for the association groups information. The ZTS-500 will retain the last selected HVAC system type.
