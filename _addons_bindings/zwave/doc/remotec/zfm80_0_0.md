The ZFM-80 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ZFM-80US Fixture Switch Module is a Z-Wave enabled device and fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. It allows remote On/Off control of specified resistive household appliance. Each fixture switch module is designed to act as a repeater, which will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacle and radio dead spots.

Key Features:

  * High output power
  * Remote ON/OFF control via the Z-Wave controller
  * Manual ON/OFF control with the front panel push button
  * Support External ON/OFF key connects to the module
  * Advanced function

Conditional trigger for "Fail Safe Installation"

  * Support Network Wide Inclusion (NWI) and Explore Frames
  * Screw terminals for wires connection
  * Flexible mounting structure - mount inside gang box or any place

### Inclusion Information

Include or exclude the Fixture Switch Module from the existing ZWave home control network with your primary controller.

  * Refer to your primary controller instructions to process the inclusion / exclusion setup procedure.
  * When prompted by your primary controller, click once on the PROG button or external switch.
  * The primary controller should indicate that the action was successful. If the controller indicates the action was unsuccessful, please repeat the procedure.
  * Once the Fixture Switch Module is part of the network, the same basic procedure is used to add the Fixture Switch Module to groups or scenes. Refer to the primary controller's instructions for details.

### Exclusion Information

Click once on the PROG button or external switch.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZFM-80 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the ZFM-80.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | ExternalSwitchType | Set External switch type Definitions |
| 2 | Timeout | Set timeout period |
| 3 | NodeIdNumber | Configure Node ID number for Z-Wave command source |
| 4 | OutputStatus | Set relay output status if timeout period has been reached |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: ExternalSwitchType

Set External switch type Definitions
ZFM-80 provides an option to user that can add an external switch to control the On/Off function. ZFM-80US can be placed into the switch box with external wall switch cover. User can configure the external switch type through the configuration command
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | TypeA |
| 2 | TypeB |
| 3 | TypeC |
| 4 | TypeD |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (TypeC).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Timeout

Set timeout period
ZFM-80US provides an advanced function "Conditional trigger for Fail Safe Installation". It can turn on or turn off the relay if ZFM-80US has not received any Z-Wave commands from a specified Z-Wave Node ID and within a specified period. For example: Z-Wave gateway can monitor a Z-Wave device status and power on equipment if this Z-Wave device is out of service.

(default value is 0 [function disabled])
Values in the range 0 to 240 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: NodeIdNumber

Configure Node ID number for Z-Wave command source
ZFM-80US provides an advanced function "Conditional trigger for Fail Safe Installation". It can turn on or turn off the relay if ZFM-80US has not received any Z-Wave commands from a specified Z-Wave Node ID and within a specified period. For example: Z-Wave gateway can monitor a Z-Wave device status and power on equipment if this Z-Wave device is out of service.

(default value is 0 [function disabled])
Values in the range 0 to 232 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: OutputStatus

Set relay output status if timeout period has been reached
 ZFM-80US provides an advanced function "Conditional trigger for Fail Safe Installation". It can turn on or turn off the relay if ZFM-80US has not received any Z-Wave commands from a specified Z-Wave Node ID and within a specified period. For example: Z-Wave gateway can monitor a Z-Wave device status and power on equipment if this Z-Wave device is out of service.

1 = turn on relay

0 = turn off relay
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZFM-80 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: AssociationGroup

Used to report the relay on/off status to specify nodes with ZFM-80US predefined association group once the relay state has been changed.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
