The manufacturer defined default value is ```-1``` (All On active, All Off active).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Switch state after power failure

Switch state after power failure

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch is OFF |
| 1 | Switch saves its state before power failure. |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Switch saves its state before power failure.).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Double click option

Double click option

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 17: Dimming time frame

Dimming time frame
Sets the time of moving the Dimmer from 0% to max. dimming values.

(The ZDM-80 will implement the dimming duration if received this parameter value from controller/gateway. Otherwise, the ZDM-80 will implement the local parameter value)
Values in the range 0 to 5 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_17_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 18: Maximum Dimmer level control

Maximum Dimmer level control
Define the upper dimming level. Higher percentages lead to higher brightness level.
Values in the range 2 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_18_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 19: Minimum Dimmer level control

Minimum Dimmer level control
Define the lower dimming level. Lower percentages lead to lower brightness level.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDM-80 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Association group_1 is used to report status change such as AUTO report to gateway.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

# Dimmer mode: 

ZDM-80 will send out related dimming level e.g. 50% by basic set command to its association group automatically when ZDM-80 received the dimming command by local switch or wireless command e.g. 50%. 

# Switch mode: 

ZDM-80 will send out related basic set command On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) to its association group automatically when ZDM-80 received On (0xFF) or Off (0x00) command by local switch or wireless command respectively. (Max. 4 nodes ID can be assigned to this association group)

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
