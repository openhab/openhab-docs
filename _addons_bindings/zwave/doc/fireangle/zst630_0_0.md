# ZST-630 Thermoptek Smoke Alarm/Smoke Detector
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZST-630*, manufactured by *Fireangle* with the thing type UID of ```fireangle_zst630_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Smoke Detector*, defining Smoke detectors.

The ZST-630 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZST-630 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The ZST-630 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZST-630 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Smoke Alarm | alarm_smoke | Door | Switch | 
| Tamper Alarm | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Smoke Alarm

Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Tamper Alarm

Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters configured.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZST-630 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Z-Wave Plus Lifeline
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Report


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification Report


This group supports 5 nodes.
