# ZHT-630 Fire Angle Thermistek Heat Alarm/Detector
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZHT-630*, manufactured by *Sprue Safety Products Ltd* with the thing type UID of ```fireangle_zht-630_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Smoke Detector*, defining Smoke detectors.

The ZHT-630 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZHT-630 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This wireless module is designed to be installed in a Z-Wave compatible heat alarm. Thermistek technology provides quick detection of rapid temperature increases. Its reaction to heat rather than smoke makes it ideal for installation in kitchen areas and garages in order to avoid false alarms caused by cooking and vehicle fumes.

### Inclusion Information

Triple-press the add button once the Z-Wave Module is on the device. The LED will show a quick blink once per second while the module is being added. This process may take as long as 30 seconds, but typically is much quicker. If you triple-press too quickly or too slowly, inclusion will not start. In this case wait a few seconds and then try again.

Upon successful inclusion, the Z-Wave Module LED will flash 3 times. If inclusion fails, the LED will simply stop its blink pattern.

### Exclusion Information

Triple-press the button on the Z-Wave Module. The LED will show a quick double-blink once per second while the module is being removed. This process may take up to 30 seconds. If you triple-press too quickly or too slowly the removing function will not start. In this case you must wait a few seconds and then try again.

Upon successful removal, the Z-Wave Module LED will flash 5 times. If removal fails, the LED will simply stop its blink pattern.

### Wakeup Information

The ZHT-630 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.




### General Usage Information



## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZHT-630 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (heat) | alarm_heat | alarm_heat | temperature_hot | Switch | 
| Alarm (system) | alarm_system | alarm_system |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm (heat)
Indicates if a heat alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_heat``` channel is of type ```alarm_heat``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```temperature_hot``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (system)
Indicates if a system alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_system``` channel is of type ```alarm_system``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZHT-630 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
