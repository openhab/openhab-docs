Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DAD-101 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

State changes
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Switch 1

Switch 1 ON/OFF associations
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch1 dimmer

Dimmer status group for S1
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Switch 2

Switch 2 ON/OFF associations
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Switch 2 dimmer

Dimmer status group for S2
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 6: Sensor 1

Group for Sensor 1 states
This group supports 10 nodes.
