## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DAS-102 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: State changes

State changes -- general

Association group 1 supports 3 nodes.

### Group 2: Switch 1

Switch 1 ON/OFF associations

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch 2

Switch 2 ON/OFF associations

Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.
