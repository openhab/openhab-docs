The SHMK10000 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SHMK10000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ABUS Z-Wave SHMK10000...

  * is a battery-operated radio magnetic contact
  * is Z-Wave PLUS compatible & certified
  * supports the Z-Wave S2 Standard (Security 2)
  * detects opening/closing by removing sensor and magnet
  * detects tampering when the housing is opened
  * has a battery-empty warning function
  * was developed for indoor installation

### Inclusion Information

  * Slide the base unit from the mounting plate and remove the safety strip from the battery compartment
  * Click the + (Add) button in your Z-Wave App and follow the further instructions
  * Press the Tamper-button 3 times within 1.5 seconds and the Status-LED on the base unit front will flash 3 times

The App will show if the Add device process was successful and the Status-LED will turn off Repeat the inclusion process from step B if it was not successful.

### Exclusion Information

  * Click the - (Remove) button in your Z-Wave App and follow the further instructions Press the Tamper-button 3 times within 1.5  
    seconds and the Status-LED on the base unit front will flash 3 times

  
The App will show if the Remove device process was successful and the Status-LED on device will flash 6 times Repeat the exclusion process from step A if it was not successful.

### Wakeup Information

The SHMK10000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press the Tamper-button 3 times within 1.5 seconds and the Status-LED on the base unit front will flash 3 times

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SHMK10000 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SHMK10000 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline association group includes command classes: Battery report, Notification report, Device Reset Locally notification and Binary report.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Binary Sensor (Door)

Binary Sensor Command Class
Root Device group(Binary Sensor) Binary Sensor Command Class:Compatible with 300 series

  1. Binary Sensor reports status of open or close door via Lifeline.
  2. When the sensor detects status change between close door and open door, the device will be triggered.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Binary Sensor (Tamper)

Binary Sensor Command
Root Device group(Binary Sensor) Binary Sensor Command Class:Compatible with 300 series 

  1. Binary Sensor reports the removed status of door sensor. 
  2. When the sensor detects status change of tamper, the device will be triggered

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Notification 1

Notification report open door or close status via Lifeline
Root Device group(Notification)

  1. Notification report open door or close status via Lifeline.
  2. When the sensor detects status change between close  
    door and open door, the device will be triggered.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Notification 2

Binary Sensor reports the removed status of door sensor
Root Device group(Notification) 

  1. Binary Sensor reports the removed status of door sensor. 
  2. When the sensor detects status change of tamper, the device will be triggered.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
