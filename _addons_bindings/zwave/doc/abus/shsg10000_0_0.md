The SHSG10000 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This is a **secure Siren **for **CEPT (Europe)**. 

Once the device is added to a Z-Wave gateway, the alarm can be released and terminated. In Event of an Alarm the high-volume siren (95dB) will sound and LED strobe lights up.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Plug the SHSG10000 into a socket
  2. Set the Gateway/Controller into inclusion mode
  3. Press the Network-button 3 times within 1.5 seconds and the Status-LED will flash 3 times
  4. If the Add device process is successful, the Status-LED will turn off.
  5. Repeat the inclusion process from step 2 if it was not successful.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Plug the SHSG10000 into a socket
  2. Set the Gateway/Controller into exclusion mode
  3. Press the Network-button 3 times within 1.5 seconds and the Status-LED will flash 3 times
  4. If the Remove device process is successful, the Status-LED flash 6 times.
  5. Repeat the exlusion process from step 2 if it was not successful.

### General Usage Information

In Event of main power loss, the Siren can even operate up to 5 minutes in Alarm case by the integrated backup-battery (or 4 hours standby operation).

Please make sure the internal battery is fully charged.

**To reset the device:**

  1. Press the Network-button for 10 seconds to factory reset the device

Note:

  * This procedure should only be used if the primary gateway is not capable of acting.
  * If the multi-sensor is set to the factory setting, the status is set to "not included", the association settings and possible configurations are reset to default.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SHSG10000 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SHSG10000 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline association group includes command classes: Switch Binary report, Battery and Device Reset Locally notification.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
