The SHHA10000 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The SHHA10000 was developed for use in home automation systems that use the Z-Wave wireless standard. The power outlet enables you to switch a large number of your electronic devices - conveniently and directly via the gateway's app or automatically according to an individual schedule. In conjunction with configurable scenes, a large number of smart functions can be initiated, e.g. a presence simulation or you can preheat the coffee machine before getting up.

The ABUS Z-Wave SHHA10000...:

  * is a wireless socket
  * is Z-Wave PLUS compatible & certified
  * supports the Z-Wave S2 Standard (Security 2)
  * measures your (current) consumption values reliably over any period of time
  * detects applied mains voltage, wattage consumption, kWh and ampere
  * can be switched on and off via app or manually
  * was developed for indoor installation

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SHHA10000 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Sending Meter Report
When the state of Smart Plug (turn on or off the load) is changed:

  1. Set Configuration parameter 3 to 0 (0x00): Do not send Basic Report
  2. Set Configuration parameter 3 to 1 (0x00): Send Basic Report
  3. Set Configuration parameter 3 to 2 (0x00): Send Basic Report only when Load condition is changed not by Z-WAVE Command, such as short pressing.

Sending Meter Report.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
