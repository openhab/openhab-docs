# SHBW10000 PIR Multisensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *SHBW10000*, manufactured by *ABUS Security-Center GmbH & Co. KG * with the thing type UID of ```abus_shbw10000_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The SHBW10000 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SHBW10000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SHBW10000 was developed for use in home automation systems that use the Z-Wave wireless standard.

The multisensor has the following sensors:

  * PIR
  * temperature
  * atmospheric humidity
  * lights

The motion sensor lets you know when something moves within a certain range and can then trigger various scenes/actions.

The device also reports the current room temperature, humidity and illuminance.

In conjunction with configurable scenes, smart functions can also be initiated in addition to monitoring, e.g. if temperature <20 degrees, heating on.

### Inclusion Information

Click the + (Add) button in your Z-Wave App and follow the further instructions.

Press the Button on the device once.

The App will show if the Add device process was successful. The Status LED will light up for 2 seconds.

Repeat the inclusion process if it was not successful.

### Exclusion Information

Click the - (Remove) button in your Z-Wave App and follow the further instructions.

Press the Button on the device once.

The App will show if the Remove device process was successful.

Repeat the exclusion process if it was not successful.

### Wakeup Information

The SHBW10000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


If included:

The device sends a wake up notification command to the node devices which are connected by a wake up command.

The LED will light up when information is received, and will go out when there is no exchange for 10 seconds.

If not included: nothing

### General Usage Information

Keep pressing the Button on the device for more than 5 seconds (the flash interval of the Status LED is now accelerated)

The device is now restored to factory settings

Note: This procedure should only be used if the primary gateway is not capable of acting.

If the device is set to the factory setting, the status is set to "not included", the association settings and possible configurations are reset to default.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SHBW10000 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  * Z-Wave Plus Lifeline Notification Report: Sensor will send Notification Report when Motion Detection Unknown Location and (Event inactive). 
  * Multilevel Sensor Report: Sensor will send Multilevel Sensor Report (Temperature, humidity, luminance) interval of 2 hours.
  * Battery Report. Sensor will send Battery Report when the battery level is low and the battery report’s value is 255 (0xFF). 
  * Device Reset Locally.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Send Basic Set when PIR trigger

Send Basic Set when PIR trigger

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
