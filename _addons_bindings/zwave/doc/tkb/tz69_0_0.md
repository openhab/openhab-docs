# TZ69 Smart meter switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *TZ69*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tz69_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Power Outlet*, defining Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there.

The TZ69 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

TZ69 is an ON/OFF Z-Wave switch.

TZ69 is able to detect current wattage (10-3000W) and overwattage (3000-3300). When detecting overload state, the switch will be disabled and its On/Off button will be locked, while LED will flash quickly. However, after unplug and re-connect the switch will reset its overload condition to normal state.

In the front casing, there is an On/Off button with LED indicator which is used to toggle switch on and off or carry out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association. When first power is applied, its LED flashed on and off repeatedly at 2 seconds intervals. It implies that is has not been assigned a node ID and cannot (yet) work with Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Please put your main Z-Wave Controller into Inclusion mode.
  2. Press On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds
  3. The switch ihould be included.

The switch also has auto-inclusion mode, if it was not included. Auto inclusion will be run as long as the switch does not have Node ID and was just plugged into wall outlet. Auto inclusion timeout is 30 seconds, during which node information of eplorer frame will be emitted every 5 seconds. Unlinke manual inclusion, you do not have to press On/Off button to complete inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put your main Z-Wave controller into exclusion mode.
  2. Press On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds
  3. The switch shall be excluded (confirmed by LED blinking 1 second on, 1 second off)

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the TZ69.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | LED Indicator Mode | Sets whether LED should indicate device is on (1) or off (0) |
| 2 | Memory Function | determines if current state is memorized on power failure |
| 3 | Watt Meter Report Period | 5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour |
| 4 | kWH Meter Report Period | 10m * 6 (default) = 60m = 1 hour |
| 5 | Threshold of Watt for Load Caution | Above this level, switch enters overload mode |
| 6 | Threshold of kWH for Load Caution | Over this level, unit with go into overload mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: LED Indicator Mode

Sets whether LED should indicate device is on (1) or off (0)

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch off = LED off |
| 1 | Switch off = LED on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Switch off = LED on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

determines if current state is memorized on power failure
Manual states: TZ69 by default value is 1, when the value is 0, TZ69 memory function not used; when the value is 1, TZ69 memory function is used
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Memory function off |
| 1 | Memory function on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Memory function on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Watt Meter Report Period

5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: kWH Meter Report Period

10m * 6 (default) = 60m = 1 hour

Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Threshold of Watt for Load Caution

| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ69 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
