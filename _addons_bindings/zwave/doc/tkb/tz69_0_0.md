The TZ69 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/474) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TZ69 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (power factor) | meter_powerfactor | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (power factor)

Indicates the instantaneous power factor.

The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the TZ69.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | LED Indicator Mode | Sets whether LED should indicate device is on (1) or off (0) |
| 2 | Memory Function | determines if current state is memorized on power failure |
| 3 | Watt Meter Report Period | 5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour |
| 4 | kWH Meter Report Period | 10m \* 6 (default) = 60m = 1 hour |
| 5 | Threshold of Watt for Load Caution | Above this level, switch enters overload mode |
| 6 | Threshold of kWH for Load Caution | Over this level, unit with go into overload mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: LED Indicator Mode

Sets whether LED should indicate device is on (1) or off (0)

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch off = LED off |
| 1 | Switch off = LED on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Switch off = LED on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

determines if current state is memorized on power failure
Manual states: TZ69 by default value is 1, when the value is 0, TZ69 memory function not used; when the value is 1, TZ69 memory function is used
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Memory function off |
| 1 | Memory function on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Memory function on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Watt Meter Report Period

5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: kWH Meter Report Period

10m \* 6 (default) = 60m = 1 hour

Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Threshold of Watt for Load Caution

Above this level, switch enters overload mode
Overload mode means the switch is disabled and the LED flashes at 0.5 second intervals. Unplug unit to clear mode.
Values in the range 10 to 3000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Threshold of kWH for Load Caution

Over this level, unit with go into overload mode
Overload mode means the switch is disabled and the LED flashes at 0.5 second intervals. Unplug unit to clear mode.
Values in the range 1 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ69 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 5 nodes.
