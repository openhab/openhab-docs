The TZ79 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

### Inclusion Information

1. Have Z-Wave Controller entered inclusion mode.
2. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 secondes will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

1. Have Z-Zwave controller entered exclusion mode.
2. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 secondes will enter exclusion mode.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TZ79 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|

| Electric meter (power factor) | meter_powerfactor | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (power factor)

Indicates the instantaneous power factor.

The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the TZ79.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Change the state of indicator light |  |
| 2 | Memory Function |  |
| 3 | Watt Meter Report Period | 5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour |
| 4 | kWH Meter Report Period | 6x10min = 1 hour |
| 5 | Threshold of Watt for load caution |  |
| 6 | Threshold of kWH for load caution |  |
| 7 | Edge or Pulse mode or Edge-Toggle mode | 1 - Edge mode 2 - Pulse mode 3 - Edge toggle mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Change the state of indicator light



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED off |
| 1 | LED on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Memory function off |
| 1 | Memory function on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Memory function on).

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: kWH Meter Report Period

6x10min = 1 hour

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Threshold of Watt for load caution



Values in the range 10 to 3000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Threshold of kWH for load caution



Values in the range 0 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Edge or Pulse mode or Edge-Toggle mode

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ79 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 5 nodes.
