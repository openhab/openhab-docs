# TZ79 Insert switch module
This describes the Z-Wave device *TZ79*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tz79_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The TZ79 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The zwave power switch module TZ79 by TKB is designed to be placed into a pattress box behind a normal switch . This switch is no longer controlling the electrical load directly but acts as input device for the micro module. It has an internal relay to control the electrical load attached. With this micro module an existing installation can be turned into a Z-Wave enabled smart system keeping the original switches in place. This is particularly useful if you are using switches of a particular pattern and don't what to change them.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Have Z-Wave Controller entered inclusion mode.
  2. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 secondes will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Have Z-Zwave controller entered exclusion mode.
  2. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 secondes will enter exclusion mode.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the TZ79.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Change the state of indicator light |  |
| 2 | Memory Function |  |
| 3 | Watt Meter Report Period | 5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour |
| 4 | kWH Meter Report Period | 6x10min = 1 hour |
| 5 | Threshold of Watt for load caution |  |
| 6 | Threshold of kWH for load caution |  |
| 7 | Edge or Pulse mode or Edge-Toggle mode | 1 - Edge mode 2 - Pulse mode 3 - Edge toggle mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Change the state of indicator light



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED off |
| 1 | LED on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Memory function off |
| 1 | Memory function on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Memory function on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Watt Meter Report Period

5s x 720 (default) = 3600s = 1 hour
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value = 720), the TZ79 will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to Z-Wave controller. The maximum interval to report its instant power consumption is 45 hours (5s*36767/3600 = 45 hours)
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: kWH Meter Report Period

6x10min = 1 hour

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Threshold of Watt for load caution



Values in the range 10 to 3000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Threshold of kWH for load caution



Values in the range 0 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Edge or Pulse mode or Edge-Toggle mode

Values in the range 1 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ79 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
