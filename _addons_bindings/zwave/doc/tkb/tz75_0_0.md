The TZ75 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/801) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TZ75 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Electric meter (power factor) | meter_powerfactor | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Electric meter (power factor)

Indicates the instantaneous power factor.

The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the TZ75.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt meter report periode | Watt meter report periode |
| 2 | KWH Meter Report period | KWH Meter Report period |
| 3 | Treshold of watt for load caution | Treshold of watt for load caution |
| 4 | Treshold of KWH for load caution | Treshold of KWH for load caution |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Watt meter report periode

Watt meter report periode

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: KWH Meter Report period

KWH Meter Report period

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Treshold of watt for load caution

Treshold of watt for load caution

Values in the range 10 to 1100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Treshold of KWH for load caution

Treshold of KWH for load caution

Values in the range 0 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ75 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 1 nodes.
