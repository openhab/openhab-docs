The TZ75 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is able to detect the position of the shutter by using the patterned power measuring method, so it can not only be positioned fully up or down, but can also be adjusted to any position between 0 and 100%.

Installation hint: lt is important to carry out a shutter calibration process. Press the On/Off button over 3 seconds and release it before the 6th second, the roller shutter controller will start the shutter calibration process. The process is composed of three continue stages. The shutter move to the BOTTOM in first stage, and move to the TOP in second stage, and move to the BOTTOM again in 1-second intervals third stage. Then the TZ75 will know the total range of UP and DOWN.

### Inclusion Information

1\. Have Z-Wave controller entered inclusion mode.

2\. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

1\. Have Z-Wave controller entered exclusion mode.

2\. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Electric meter (power factor)

Indicates the instantaneous power factor.

The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the TZ75.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt meter report period | Watt meter report period |
| 2 | KWH Meter Report period | KWH Meter Report period |
| 3 | Treshold of watt for load caution | Treshold of watt for load caution |
| 4 | Treshold of KWH for load caution | Treshold of KWH for load caution |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Watt meter report period

Watt meter report period
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value =720), the TZ75 will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to the node of the corresponding group. The maximum interval to report its instant power consumption is 45 hours (5s\*32767/3600=45h).
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: KWH Meter Report period

KWH Meter Report period
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value =6), the TZ75 will report its accumulated power consumption (KW/h) every 1 hour to the node of the corresponding group. The maximum interval to report its accumulated power consumption (KW/h) is 227.55 days (10min\*32767/1440=227.55 days).
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Treshold of watt for load caution

Treshold of watt for load caution
This is the maximum power consuption which is allowed during acivation of the Roller Shutter relays up or down. Set the threshold high enough to prevent from overloads in winter etc. when the motor needs slightly more power.

When an overload state occurs, the TZ75 gets disabled and the LED flashes in 0.5 second intervals. The overload state can be cleared by disconnecting and reconnecting the TZ75 main power.
Values in the range 10 to 1100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Treshold of KWH for load caution

Treshold of KWH for load caution
The default value 0 will disable the KWh warning.
Values in the range 0 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ75 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 1 nodes.
