# TZ06 In Wall Dual Relay(1 Way) Switch Module 2x 1.5kW
This describes the Z-Wave device *TZ06*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tz06_00_000```.

The TZ06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/156) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TZ06 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |

### Switch 3

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary3``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the TZ06.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Selected endpoint | If Controller not using Multi\_Channel command class to access the endpoint of PAN06, you may configure the endpoint value to react the Basic Command Class |
| 2 | Switch mode | Change the external switch mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Selected endpoint

If Controller not using Multi\_Channel command class to access the endpoint of PAN06, you may configure the endpoint value to react the Basic Command Class

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Relay 1 + 2 |
| 2 | Relay 1 |
| 3 | Relay 2 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Relay 1 + 2).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Switch mode

Change the external switch mode

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge mode |
| 2 | Pulse mode |
| 3 | Edge-Toggle mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Edge mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ06 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Relay 1


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 3: Relay 2


This group supports 1 nodes.
