The TZ74 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This z-wave in-wall dual relay switch module TZ74 is a transceiver which is a Z-WaveTM enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Mini size design let the module can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration. There are many kind of application by using the module to switch AC power On and Off , one main application is the light control. The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of light like incandescent, fluorescent and LED light.

### Inclusion Information

Have Z-Wave Controller entered inclusion mode. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Have Z-Wave controller entered exclusion mode. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the TZ74.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Change the state of indicator light | Default status of socket LED is on as indicator when the load is off |
| 2 | Memory Function | Default with memory: the socket staus is same as before when power is on |
| 3 | Invert switch | In the edge mode invert switch - no effect if Pulse or Edge-toggle modes |
| 4 | Edge, Pulse, or Edge Toggle Mode | Set how the switch controls the module |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Change the state of indicator light

Default status of socket LED is on as indicator when the load is off

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED is off when load is off |
| 1 | LED is on when load is off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED is on when load is off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

Default with memory: the socket staus is same as before when power is on

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | socket status depends on switch |
| 1 | socket status is same as before power outage |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (socket status is same as before power outage).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Invert switch

In the edge mode invert switch - no effect if Pulse or Edge-toggle modes

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Normal |
| 1 | In the edge mode invert switch |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Normal).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Edge, Pulse, or Edge Toggle Mode

Set how the switch controls the module

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge Mode |
| 2 | Pulse Mode |
| 3 | Edge-toggle Mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (Edge-toggle Mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ74 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
