## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the TZ37.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Night light | Configure LED to reflect load's status |
| 2 | Memory Function | Toggles the Switch's memory function |
| 3 | Invert switch | Inverts switch's top/bottom |
| 4 | LED transmission indication | LED flickers when transmitting data to any group |
| 5 | Don't transmit to Group 4 | Disables transmitting to Group 4 |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Night light

Configure LED to reflect load's status
The LED on the switch will by default turn ON when the load attached is turned OFF. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned ON, alter this configuration parameter.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

Toggles the Switch's memory function
This will turn the Switch's memory function ON/OFFThis is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (On).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Invert switch

Inverts switch's top/bottom
**If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.**This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Default |
| 1 | Invert |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: LED transmission indication

LED flickers when transmitting data to any group
Determines whether the switch's LED will flicker when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No indication |
| 1 | Temporary Indication |
| 2 | Continuous Indication |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Temporary Indication).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Don't transmit to Group 4

Disables transmitting to Group 4
Disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from from the group.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Transmit to Group 4 |
| 1 | Don't transmit to Group 4 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Transmit to Group 4).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ37 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Dimmer 1

Use the Left Switch to control a group
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/Off dimmer 2 

Control Group using right switch
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Wireless

Switch state controls group
This group supports 5 nodes.
