| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (On).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Invert switch

Inverts switch's top/bottom
**If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch. **This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Default |
| 1 | Invert |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: LED transmission indication

LED flickers when transmitting data to any group
Determines whether the switch's LED will flicker when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups 
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No indication |
| 1 | Temporary Indication |
| 2 | Continuous Indication |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Temporary Indication).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Don't transmit to Group 4

Disables transmitting to Group 4
Disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from from the group. This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Transmit to Group 4 |
| 1 | Don't transmit to Group 4 |

| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ37 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 1, you can turn that device:

  * ON and OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the right switch
  * Brighten or dim devices by pushing and holding the top of the right switch
  * Dim by pushing and holding the bottom of the right switch.

The load attached to the switch is not affected. The LED on the right switch will indicate the status of Group 1.

Group 1 will be polled at a specific interval and the LED on the right switch will indicate the status of Group 1.  
The polling interval can be configured.

The Group1 name is lifeline(Profile MSB=0x00,Profile LSB=0x01)

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Dimmer 1

Use the Left Switch to control a group
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 2, you can:

  * Turn that device ON or OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the left switch twice.
  * You can brighten or dim devices by: 
      * Tapping the switch once
      * Then push and hold the top or bottom of the left switch.

The load attached to the switch is not affected. The LED on the left switch will indicate the status of Group 2.

Group 2 will be polled at a specific interval and the LED on the left switch will indicate the status of Group 2. The polling interval can be configured. The Group2 name is On /Off Dimmer 1(Profile MSB=0x20,Profile LSB=0x01).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/Off dimmer 2 

Control Group using right switch
 If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 3, you can:

  * Turn that device ON or OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the righ switch twice.
  * Brighten or dim devices by: 
      * Tapping the switch once
      * Then push and hold the top or bottom of the righ switch.

The load attached to the switch is not affected.

The Group3 name is On/Off dimmer 2 (Profile MSB= 0x20,Profile LSB=0x02).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Wireless

Switch state controls group
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 4, that device will be commanded to turn on or off when the switch is commanded to turn on or off

Caution: The switch will not transmit to Z-Wave devices in Group 4 if it is already in the state that the Z-Wave command commanded it to.

A note about dimming, if you combine Z-Wave enabled dimmers and other types of Z-Wave devices in a group, place a Z-Wave enabled dimmer into the empty group first to ensure that the dimming operates correctly.

The Group4 name is wireless.(Profile MSB=0x20, Profile LSB=0x03) 

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
