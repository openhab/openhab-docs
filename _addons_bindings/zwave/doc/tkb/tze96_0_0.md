The TZE96 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Thermostat TZE96 is a 230AC powered device which works in Z-Wave network. It is mounted on Wall with using electrical box. It has additional input for temperature sensor mounted in floor. Screen shows actual temperature in room or floor and clock. Thermostat has relay which could control load up to 16A (3600W). The possibility of defining the heating schedule. The ability to adjust the comfort mode, economy mode, party mode, holiday mode and control program mode.

  * This model has a glass front and color touchscreen.
  * Set contains cable temperature sensor for floor heating.
  * Works in the newest standard Z-Wave Plus (500 series). Thermostat works fine with Fibaro (4.x firmware) and Vera gateways.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the TZE96.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Power failure | Remember device status before the power failure. |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 4: Power failure

Remember device status before the power failure.
This parameter determines how the TZE96 thermostat will react in the event of power supply failure (e.g. power outage or taking out from the electrical outlet). After the power supply is back on, the thermostat can be restored to previous state or remain switched off. 
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switched OFF |
| 1 | Restore state |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Restore state).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZE96 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
