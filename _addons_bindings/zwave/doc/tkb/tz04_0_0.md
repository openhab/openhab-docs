The TZ04 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This in-wall switch module is able to detect Instant power wattage (5~1500W) and overload wattage (1600~1700W) of connected light or appliances.

When detecting overload state, the Module will be disabled and its On/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly. However, disconnect and re-connect the Module will reset its overload condition to normal status.

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Exists |
| 2 | Doesn't Exist |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Exists).

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ04 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Relay 1


Association group 2 supports 1 node.
