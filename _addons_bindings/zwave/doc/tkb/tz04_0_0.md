Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | W meter report period | Period for reporting W meter |
| 2 | kWh meter report period | Period for reporting kWh meter |
| 3 | Selected endpoint | Which endpoint is addressed by the BASIC command class |
| 4 | Switch mode | Change the external switch mode |
| 5 | Threshold of Watt for Load Caution | If threshold of wattage is reached, a meter report will be generated |

If the setting is configured for 1 hour (value = 720), the device will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to Z-Wave Controller. Unit: 5 seconds
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: kWh meter report period

Period for reporting kWh meter
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (value = 6), the device will report its total power consumption every 1 hour to Z-Wave Controller.

Unit: 10 minutes
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Selected endpoint

Which endpoint is addressed by the BASIC command class
If the Controller is not using Multi\_Channel command class to access the endpoint of TZ04, you may configure the endpoint value to react the Basic Command Class
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Relay 1 + 2 |

If the TZ04 relay changes state due to a Z-Wave command, the switch may need to be toggled twice (On->Off or Off->On) to change the relay state.

Pulse Mode: This mode is suitable for momentary contact type wall switches to change the state of relay 1 or relay 2.

Edge-Toggle mode: This mode is suitable for normal toggle (bi-stable) switches. Every time the state of the wall switch changes the state of relay 1 or relay 2 will also change.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge mode |
| 2 | Pulse mode |
| 3 | Edge-Toggle mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Edge mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Threshold of Watt for Load Caution

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Exists |
| 2 | Doesn't Exist |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Exists).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ04 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Relay 1


This group supports 1 nodes.
