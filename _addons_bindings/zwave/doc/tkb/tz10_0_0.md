## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the TZ10.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Memory function | The thermostat will recover the operating mode after a power failure. |

### Parameter 4: Memory function

The thermostat will recover the operating mode after a power failure.

The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 1 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ10 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: State control


Association group 2 supports 2 nodes.
