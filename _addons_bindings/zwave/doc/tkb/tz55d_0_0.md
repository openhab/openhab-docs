## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the TZ55D.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Night Light | LED Mode |
| 2 | Memory Function | Switch memory function |
| 3 | Invert Switch | Reverse switch direction |
| 4 | LED Transmission Indication | Set LED flickering mode |
| 5 | Suspend Group 4 | Disable transmitting commands to devices that are in Group 4 |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Night Light

LED Mode
The LED on the switch will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turn OFF. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turn ON instead, set parameter 1 to a value of 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

Switch memory function
Stated in the above form, switch by default value is 1, when the value is 0, switch memory function not open; when the value is 1, open switch memory function.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Invert Switch

Reverse switch direction
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON, set parameter 3 to 1.  
Note: if you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: LED Transmission Indication

Set LED flickering mode
The switch will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 2), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 1).  
By default, the switch is set to flicker for only 1 second.
Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmitting commands to devices that are in Group 4
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from from the group. Setting parameter 5 to the value of 1 will stop the switch from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ55D supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Group 1 Control
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 1, you can turn that device ON and OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the right switch, you can brighten or dim devices by pushing and holding the top of the right switch Dim by pushing and holding the bottom of the right switch.

  
The load attached to the switch is not affected.

The LED on the right switch will indicate the status of Group 1. Group 1 will be polled at a specific interval and the LED on the right switch will indicate the status of Group 1. The polling interval can be configured. The Group1 name is lifeline(Profile MSB=0x00,Profile LSB=0x01)
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Dimmer 1

Group 2 Control
Group 2 Control: If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 2, you can turn that device ON or OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the left switch twice. You can brighten or dim devices by tapping the switch once then push and hold the top or bottom of the left switch.  
  
The load attached to the switch is not affected.  
  
The LED on the left switch will indicate the status of Group 2. Group 2 will be polled at a specific interval and the LED on the left switch will indicate the status of Group 2. The polling interval can be configured. The Group2 name is On/Off Dimmer 1(Profile MSB=0x20,Profile LSB=0x01).
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/off dimmer 2

Group 3 Control
Group 3 Control: If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 3, you can turn that device ON or OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the righ switch twice. You can brighten or dim devices by tapping the switch once then push and hold the top or bottom of the righ switch.  
  
The load attached to the switch is not affected.  
  
The Group3 name is on off dimmer 2 (Profile MSB=0x20,Profile LSB=0x02).
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Wireless

Group 4 Control
Group 4 Control: If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 4, that device will be commanded to turn on or off when the switch is commanded to turn on or off Caution: The switch will not transmit to Z-Wave devices in Group 4 if it is already in the state that the Z-Wave command commanded it to.  
  
The Group4 name is wireless.(Profile MSB=0x20, Profile LSB=0x03)
This group supports 5 nodes.
