The TZ55D supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Dual Paddle Wall Dimmer, AC230V 50Hz, 1380W×2The device can control only one attached load and dim/brighten associated Z-Wave dimmers

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

### General Usage Information

**Basic Operation (Local Control)  
** The left paddle on the switch allows the user to:  
-The on or off the attached load.  
-Include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave system.  
-Control other Z-Wave enabled devices.  
The right paddle on the switch allows the user to:  
-Control other Z-Wave enable devices  
Also when a controller prompts you to “Send Node ID” or to “Press Button on Unit”, quickly tap the switch on or off three times to satisfy those instructions.  
  
**Paddle Operation:  
** -Tapping top of left paddle turns the load attached on.  
-Tapping bottom of left paddle turns the load attached off.  
-Pressing and holding the left paddle will dim/brighten the attached load.  
-Pressing and holding the right paddle does not affect the attached load but will allow dimming and brightening of associated Z-Wave dimmers. 

**Caution:** When dimmed at the lowest setting, even though the load looks like its off, it still has power. Tap the bottom of the switch to turn off completely. It is best to turn off the power at the circuit breaker to service the load. 

**Note:**  
The right paddle does not send updates to the lifeline group except ON/OFF commands.  
When using rules, if you set low pooling interval you will receive multiple updates as the device is dimming. (I.e. When you send the command from 0 to 90, you will receive 30, 60 and finally 90.)  
Upon restoration of power after a power loss, the switch returns to a previously known state. 

**LED Indication **  
The LED on the switch will turn on when the load attached is off, to act as a night light. However, the LED can be user configured to turn on when the load attached is on the switch will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups.  
This can be changed if desired. See“LED transmission indication” 

**Remote Control **  
The switch will respond to BASIC and BINARY commands that are part of the Z-Wave system. refer to your controller's instructions as to whether your controller can transmit those commands.

| 3 | Invert Switch | Reverse switch direction |
| 4 | LED Transmission Indication | Set LED flickering mode |
| 5 | Suspend Group 4 | Disable transmitting commands to devices that are in Group 4 |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Night Light

LED Mode
The LED on the switch will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turn OFF. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turn ON instead, set parameter 1 to a value of 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

Switch memory function
Stated in the above form, switch by default value is 1, when the value is 0, switch memory function not open; when the value is 1, open switch memory function.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Invert Switch

Reverse switch direction
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON, set parameter 3 to 1.  
Note: if you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: LED Transmission Indication

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ55D supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 Control
If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 1, you can turn that device ON and OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the right switch, you can brighten or dim devices by pushing and holding the top of the right switch Dim by pushing and holding the bottom of the right switch.

  
The load attached to the switch is not affected.

The LED on the right switch will indicate the status of Group 1. Group 1 will be polled at a specific interval and the LED on the right switch will indicate the status of Group 1. The polling interval can be configured. The Group1 name is lifeline(Profile MSB=0x00,Profile LSB=0x01)

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Dimmer 1

Group 2 Control
Group 2 Control: If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 2, you can turn that device ON or OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the left switch twice. You can brighten or dim devices by tapping the switch once then push and hold the top or bottom of the left switch.  
  
The load attached to the switch is not affected.  
  
The LED on the left switch will indicate the status of Group 2. Group 2 will be polled at a specific interval and the LED on the left switch will indicate the status of Group 2. The polling interval can be configured. The Group2 name is On/Off Dimmer 1(Profile MSB=0x20,Profile LSB=0x01).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/off dimmer 2

Group 3 Control
Group 3 Control: If you associate a Z-Wave device into Group 3, you can turn that device ON or OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the righ switch twice. You can brighten or dim devices by tapping the switch once then push and hold the top or bottom of the righ switch.  
  
The load attached to the switch is not affected.
