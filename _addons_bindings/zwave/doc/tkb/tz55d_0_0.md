## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the TZ55D.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Night Light | LED Mode |
| 2 | Memory Function | Switch memory function |
| 3 | Invert Switch | Reverse switch direction |
| 4 | LED Transmission Indication | Set LED flickering mode |
| 5 | Suspend Group 4 | Disable transmitting commands to devices that are in Group 4 |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Night Light

LED Mode
The LED on the switch will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turn OFF. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turn ON instead, set parameter 1 to a value of 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

Switch memory function
Stated in the above form, switch by default value is 1, when the value is 0, switch memory function not open; when the value is 1, open switch memory function.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Invert Switch

Reverse switch direction
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON, set parameter 3 to 1.  
Note: if you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: LED Transmission Indication

Set LED flickering mode
The switch will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 2), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 1).  
By default, the switch is set to flicker for only 1 second.
Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmitting commands to devices that are in Group 4
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from from the group. Setting parameter 5 to the value of 1 will stop the switch from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ55D supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Group 1 Control
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Dimmer 1

Group 2 Control
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/off dimmer 2

Group 3 Control
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Wireless

Group 4 Control
This group supports 5 nodes.
