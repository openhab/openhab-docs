# TZ78 In Wall Micro Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *TZ78*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tz78_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The TZ78 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This insert switch module in a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network.

Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer's Z-Wave enabled networks.

Remote On/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer's wireless controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TZ78 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the TZ78.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Change the state of indicator light | Default status of socket LED is on as indicator when the load is off |
| 2 | Memory Function | Default with memory: the socket status is same as before when power on |
| 3 | Switch Mode | Edge or Pulse mode or EdgeToggle mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Change the state of indicator light

Default status of socket LED is on as indicator when the load is off

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED ON when load is ON |
| 1 | LED ON when load is OFF |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED ON when load is OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory Function

Default with memory: the socket status is same as before when power on

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No state memory after pwr failure |
| 1 | State memory after pwr failure |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (State memory after pwr failure).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Switch Mode

Edge or Pulse mode or EdgeToggle mode
Edge mode: this mode is suitable for the bi stable wall switch that has indicator point on the switch, and the same position correspond to same state of relay1.  
Pulse mode: this mode is suitable for the toggle type wall switch to swap the state of Relay1.  
Edge-Toggle mode: this mode is suitable for the normal bi-stable switch, every time when change the state of the wall switch will also swap the state of Relay1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge mode |
| 2 | Pulse mode |
| 3 | Edge-Toggle mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (Edge-Toggle mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ78 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
