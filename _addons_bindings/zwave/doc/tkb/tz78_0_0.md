The TZ78 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This insert switch module in a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network.

Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer's Z-Wave enabled networks.

Remote On/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer's wireless controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.
