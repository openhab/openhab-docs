The TZ77 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

12V DC operating voltage.

This insert switch module is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device  
and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network.   
Remote on/off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer's  
wireless controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing ON/OFF button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the TZ77.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Indicator light state | Change the state of indicator light |
| 2 | Memory function | Socket status when powered on |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Indicator light state

Change the state of indicator light
Default status of socket: LED is on as indicator when the load is off
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory function

Socket status when powered on
Default with memory: the socket status is same as before when power on
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ77 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Group 1
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2
This group supports 5 nodes.
