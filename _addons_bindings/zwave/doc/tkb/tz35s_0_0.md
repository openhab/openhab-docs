# TZ35S Single Paddle Wall Dimmer
This describes the Z-Wave device *TZ35S*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tz35s_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The TZ35S supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

TZ35S Wall Mounted Switch
=========================

The TZ35S Wall Mounted 3-Way Dimmer Switch is a component of the lighting control system.

This Wall Mounted Dimmer Switch is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave node of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.

As part of a Z-Wave network, the TZ35S will also act as a wireless repeater to insure the commands intended for another device in the network are received.

Basic Operation
===============

(Local control)
---------------

The switch on the TZ35S allows the user to:

- Turn ON/OFF or Dimming the attached load
- Include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave system
- Control other Z-Wave enabled devices

Also, when a controller prompts you to "Send Node ID" or to "Press Button on Unit", quickly tap the switch ON or OFF once to satisfy those instructions.

- Tapping top of the switch turns the load attached ON
- Tapping bottom of switch turns the load attached OFF
- Pressing and holding the switch will allow dimming and brightening of the attached load or the other Z-Wave dimmers if associated.

**Caution**: When dimmed to the lowest setting, even though the load looks like its off it still has power. Tap bottom of switch to turn off completely. It is best to turn off the power at the circuit breaker to service the load. Returns to known ON/OFF state after power loss.

**Note:** Upon restoration of power after a power loss, the switch returns to previous known state.

**Maximum load:** 300W

### Inclusion Information

Including TZ35 to the network
=============================

**Including to the network (must be installed in its permanent location, not on test bench)**

1. Setup the controller you are using to include a device into network.
2. Tap either the top or bottom of the switch once.

### Exclusion Information

**Excluding from the network**
==============================

1. Setup the controller you are using to exclude a device from the network.
2. Tap either the top or the bottom of the switch once.

Reset
=====

1. Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.
2. Within 5 second,press On/Off button again for 1 seconds until LED is off
3. IDs are excluded.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TZ35S -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the TZ35S.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Ignore start level bit | Ignore start level bit |
| 3 | Night light | Indicates if LED is on when load is ON |
| 4 | Invert switch | Invert switch behaviour |
| 19 | LED transmission indicator | LED flickering during transmission |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Ignore start level bit

Ignore start level bit
Set ignore start level bit when transmitting dim commands

- Parameter No.: 1
- Length: 1 byte
- Valid values = 0 or 1 (default 1)

The TZ35S can send dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from the start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. If this bit is set to 0 the dimmer will not ignore the start level.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Don't ignore start level |
| 1 | Ignore start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night light

Indicates if LED is on when load is ON
The LED on the TZ35S will be by default turn ON when the load attached is turned OFF. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned ON instead set parameter 3 to a value of 1
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Night LED on |
| 1 | Night LED off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Night LED on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert switch

Invert switch behaviour
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON, set parameter to 1
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | ON command on TOP |
| 1 | OFF command on TOP |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (ON command on TOP).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 19: LED transmission indicator

LED flickering during transmission
The switch will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 2 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the switch is set to flicker for only 1 second. Each configuration parameter can be set to its default setting by setting the default bit in the configuration set command. see your controllerâ€™s instructions on how to do this(and if it supports it). All configuration commands will be reset to their default state when the switch is reset from the Z-Wave system.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No flicker |
| 1 | Flicker all time |
| 2 | One second flicker |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (One second flicker).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ35S supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

Group 1 Control
This group supports 5 nodes.
