The TZ08 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is designed to switch rise/lower roller shutter connected to its terminals using radio waves, controllers and a push button directly connected to this Roller Controller.

This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is a transceiver which is a Z-WaveTM enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Slim design let the Controller can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the TZ08.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt meter report period |  |
| 2 | KWh meter report period |  |
| 3 | Watt load caution threshold |  |
| 4 | KWh load caution threshold |  |

### Parameter 1: Watt meter report period



Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: KWh meter report period



Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Watt load caution threshold



Values in the range 10 to 1100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: KWh load caution threshold

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ08 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 1 node.
