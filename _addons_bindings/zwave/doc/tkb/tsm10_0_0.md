# TSM10 Door/Window Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *TSM10*, manufactured by *TKB Home* with the thing type UID of ```tkb_tsm10_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The TSM10 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The TSM10 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

A slim door/window sensor.

### Inclusion Information

Once the Z-Wave controller has entered inclusion mode, pressing tamper key on the TSM10 three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.  
LED will twinkle to indicate success.

### Exclusion Information

Once the Z-Wave controller has entered exclusion mode, pressing tamper key on the TSM10 three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.  
LED will twinkle to indicate success. Once excluded  LED will flash one second on, one second off.

### Wakeup Information

The TSM10 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


When the power on, the device will wake about 10 seconds. In this duration, the controller can communicate with the device. Normally the device is always sleeping to save the battery energy.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TSM10 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the TSM10.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Turn Off Light Time | Delay before turning light off again. |
| 2 | Basic Set Level | Lights on, or dimmer setting. |
| 3 | Wake up interval | Interval between wake up and auto report. |
| 4 | Operation Mode | Security / Home Automation mode |
| 5 | Ignore Magnetic Off | Ignore door/window closing |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Turn Off Light Time

Delay before turning light off again.
After turn on light, setting the delay time to turn off the light. 10 seconds per tick, and minimum time is 30 seconds, default tick 3 (30 seconds).
Values in the range 3 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Basic Set Level

Lights on, or dimmer setting.
Setting the BASIC command value to turn on the light. The 255 means turn on the light. For dimmer equipment 1 to 99 means the light strength.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Wake up interval

Interval between wake up and auto report.
The interval time between waking up. 1 hour per tick and minimum time is 1 hour, default tick is 12 (12 hours). Maximum time is 168 hours (7 days).
Values in the range 1 to 168 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```12```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Operation Mode

Security / Home Automation mode
1 means security mode - only reports events to controller.

2 means home automation mode - reports events to controller and sends commands to lighting.
Values in the range 1 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Ignore Magnetic Off

Ignore door/window closing
0 means light control action with the door/window close.

1 means ignore the door/window close.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TSM10 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Lightcontrol


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
