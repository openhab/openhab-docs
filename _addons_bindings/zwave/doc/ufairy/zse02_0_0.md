# ZSE02 Zooz Z‑Wave Plus Motion Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZSE02*, manufactured by *UFairy G.R. Tech* with the thing type UID of ```ufairy_zse02_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The ZSE02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSE02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Detects motion and sends wireless notifications, Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication, two alternative power sources: 4 AAA batteries or mini USB cable (DC 5V / 1A), may be associated and grouped with other Z-Wave devices for advanced home automation.

  * Detection Radius: 110° / 16-23 feet
  * Power Consumption: < 15mA when idle / < 38mA when active
  * Range: Up to 100 feet line of sight
  * Operating Temperature: 14 °F to 122 °F
  * Operating Humidity: ≤ 80%
  * Indoor only

### Inclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave hub in inclusion/pairing mode, press the Z-Wave button on the motion sensor TWICE quickly (to unlock and lock it, make sure the button is pushed in when you finish the process).

### Exclusion Information

Put your Z-Wave controller in exclusion/unpairing mode, press the Z-Wave button on the motion sensor TWICE quickly (to unlock and lock it)

### Wakeup Information

The ZSE02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press the Z-Wave button on the motion sensor TWICE quickly (to unlock and lock it) to put the sensor in a wake-up mode when changing configuration or association settings.

### General Usage Information

If your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may need to reset the device to factory settings. To complete the reset process manually, please press the Z-Wave button 6 TIMES quickly (3 unlock-lock cycles).

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSE02 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_motion | alarm_motion | Motion | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE02 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
