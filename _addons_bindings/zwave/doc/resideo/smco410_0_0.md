The SMCO410 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SMCO410 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

### Inclusion Information

The SMCO410 is powered up and if user presses and hold down test button for approx. 10+ seconds until

2x green led blink and 2x beep and release it, the SMC0410 device start the Learn mode. After the

conclusion of learn mode (or timeout), the SMCO410 device will remain awake for 25 seconds. The

SMCO410 device supports both classic and NWI (network wide inclusion) Inclusion modes. When entering

learn mode, the SMCO410 device will go into classic mode for 5 seconds. If classic inclusion does not start

before the 5 second timeout, the SMCO410 will fall back to NWI mode. 

### Exclusion Information

The SMCO410 is powered up and if user presses and hold down test button for approx. 10+ seconds until

2x green led blink and 2x beep and release it, the SMC0410 device start the Learn mode. After the

conclusion of learn mode (or timeout), the SMCO410 device will remain awake for 25 seconds. The

SMCO410 device supports both classic and NWE (network wide exclusion) exclusion modes. When

entering learn mode, the SMCO410 device will go into classic mode for 5 seconds. If classic exclusion does

not start before the 5 second timeout, the SMCO410 will fall back to NWE mode. 

### Wakeup Information

The SMCO410 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The SMCO410 will send the Wake-up Notification after completion Test operation. The user will initiate

the test operation on the device by pressing the test button for approx. 0-10 seconds until 1x green led

blink and 1xbeep and release it. The device will perform the test operation on the device and after

completion of the test operation, the device will send Wakeup notification. The SMCO410 will wait for 10

seconds to receive the Wake-up No more information message from the Z-wave® controller. If the

message received, the SMCO410 will go into the sleep mode immediately, else the SMCO410 device will

go into the sleep mode after 10 second timer expire in idle mode (No ongoing communication with the Zwave® Controller). 

The SMCO410 will also send the Wake-up notification if wake up interval is configured. The SMCO410

supports the wakeup interval as 3hrs interval. Mostly the SMCO410 device will send the Wake-up

notification along with the Heartbeat message.

Following are the Wake-up interval parameters,

• DEFAULT\_SLEEP\_TIME: 0 seconds

• MIN\_SLEEP\_TIME: 0 seconds

• MAX\_SLEEP\_TIME: 10800 seconds (3 hours)

• STEP\_SLEEP\_TIME: 0

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the SMCO410.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | SuperVision Report Timeout | SMCO410 will send the message over SuperVision Command Class, and it will wait for the SuperVision report from the Controller for the SuperVision report timeout time. |
| 2 | SuperVision Retry Count | If the SuperVision report is not received within the SuperVision report timeout time, the SMCO410 will retry sending the message again. Upon exceeding the max retry, the SMCO410 device will send the next message available in the queue. |
| 3 | SuperVision Wait Time | Before retrying the message, SMCO410 will wait for the SuperVision wait time. Actual wait time is calculated using below formula, Wait time = SuperVision wait time base-value + random-value + (attempt-count x 5 seconds)  The random value shall be a time |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: SuperVision Report Timeout

SMCO410 will send the message over SuperVision Command Class, and it will wait for the SuperVision report from the Controller for the SuperVision report timeout time.

Values in the range 500 to 5000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1500```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: SuperVision Retry Count

If the SuperVision report is not received within the SuperVision report timeout time, the SMCO410 will retry sending the message again. Upon exceeding the max retry, the SMCO410 device will send the next message available in the queue.

Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: SuperVision Wait Time

Before retrying the message, SMCO410 will wait for the SuperVision wait time. Actual wait time is calculated using below formula, Wait time = SuperVision wait time base-value + random-value + (attempt-count x 5 seconds)  The random value shall be a time

Values in the range 1 to 60 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SMCO410 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
The alarm supports one association group (Lifeline) and sends its alarms to that group. The Z-wave® network controller may be set in this group. It is not recommended to modify this association group. All the critical events in the list of supported event


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
