### Door Lock

Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.

### Alarm (raw)

Provides the raw alarm status information as a string, including alarm type and level, in the following json format:

 {"notification":"ACCESS\_\_MANUAL\_LOCK", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"1","status":"255"} {"notification":"ACCESS\_\_MANUAL\_UNLOCK", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"2","status":"255"} {"notification":"ACCESS\_\_KEYPAD\_LOCK", "code":"1", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"5","status":"255"} {"notification":"ACCESS\_\_KEYPAD\_UNLOCK","code":"1", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"6","status":"255"} {"notification":"ACCESS\_\_LOCK\_JAMMED", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"11","status":"255"} {"notification":"ACCESS\_\_KEYPAD\_LOCK", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"5","status":"255"} {"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_KEYPAD\_TEMPORARILY\_DISABLED", "type":"ACCESS\_CONTROL","event":"16","status":"255"} {"notification":"BURGLAR\_\_TAMPER\_UNKNOWN", "type":"BURGLAR","event":"2","status":"255"} {"notification":"HOME\_SECURITY\_\_INTRUSION\_UNKNOWN", "type":"BURGLAR","event":"2","status":"255"} {"notification":"POWER\_\_REPLACE\_BATTERY\_SOON", "type":"POWER\_MANAGEMENT","event":"10","status":"255"} {"notification":"POWER\_MANAGEMENT\_\_REPLACE\_BATTERY\_SOON", "type":"POWER\_MANAGEMENT","event":"10","status":"255"}
