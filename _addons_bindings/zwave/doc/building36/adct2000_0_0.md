The ADC-T 2000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * Intelligently Connected with Alarm.com (Alarm.com account required) 
  * Remote Access and Control 
  * Custom Schedules 
  * Critical Temperature Alerts and Geo-Services Automation 
  * Can be paired with Alarm.com Temperature Sensor ADC-S2000-T-RA for enhanced climate control and improved energy savings (sold separately)

### Inclusion Information

Put thermostat in OFF mode (no mode icons are lit)

Press and hold the DOWN button to begin inclusion mode. Release when the RADIO icon lights up.

When the RADIO icon becomes solid, the thermostat has been included.

### Exclusion Information

Put thermostat in OFF mode (no mode icons are lit)

Press and hold the DOWN button to begin exclusion mode. Release when the RADIO icon lights up.

When the RADIO icon flashes red, the thermostat has been excluded.

### Wakeup Information

The ADC-T 2000 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ADC-T 2000 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.
