The DZS15 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Leviton’s Decora® Z-Wave® control components are designed to communicate with each other via Radio Frequency (RF) to provide remote control of your lighting. In a Z-Wave® network, each device is designed to act as a router. These routers will re-transmit the RF signal from one device to another until the intended device is reached. This ensures that the signal is received by its intended device by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. The Scene Capable Electronic Switch is compatible with any Z-Wave® enabled network, regardless of the manufacturer and can also be used with other devices displaying the Z-Wave® logo.

### Inclusion Information

To put the device into inlusion mode, engage the air-gap switch by gently pressing the top of the push pad until the bottom lifts completely out of the frame and a click is heard (refer to figure). Wait 5 seconds and then press the push pad back into the frame and hold push pad until the locator LED turns Amber. If you do not let go after the LED turns amber, the LED will turn red and the device will hard reset.

### Exclusion Information

Exclusion steps are the same as Inclusion.

Hard Reset:

If your switch is not responding, or you are unable to control it after you have tried to Include/Exclude it multiple times, it may be necessary to reset the switch to its original factory settings. To accomplish this, proceed as follows:

On the switch, engage the air-gap switch by gently pressing the top of the push pad until the bottom lifts completely out of the frame and a click is heard (refer to figure). Wait 5 seconds and then press the push pad back into the frame and hold push pad until the locator LED turns Amber and then flashes Red. The switch is now reset. Once the switch is reset, it will be necessary to Re-Include it to a network before it can be used.

CAUTION: SETTING A DEVICE TO A FACTORY DEFAULT DOES NOT EXCLUDE THAT DEVICE FROM A NETWORK. THE EXCLUSION PROCEDURE MUST STILL BE FOLLOWED TO REMOVE THE DEVICE FROM THE PRIMARY CONTROLLER’S INFORMATION TABLE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN SYSTEM THAT IS SLOW TO RESPOND, OR MAY FAIL TO RESPOND TO SOME DEVICES.

### General Usage Information

LED Option: 

Sets the Locator LED timeout to 5 seconds after use. To enter programming mode press and hold the push pad for 10 seconds until the locator LED begins to blink. Upon holding the push pad, the LED Option will automatically be changed. The default is to have the locator always visible. The nect setting is to have the locator turn off 5s after use.
