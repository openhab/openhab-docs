_Factory Default:_  
  
If your dimmer is not responding, or you are unable to control it after you have tried to Include/Exclude it multiple times, it may be necessary to reset the dimmer to its original factory settings. To accomplish this, proceed as follows:  
  
On the dimmer, engage he air-gap switch (refer to Operation section) and wait 5 seconds. Press push pad back into frame and hold push pad until the locator LED turns Amber and then turns Red. The dimmer is now reset. Once the dimmer is reset, it will be necessary to Re-Include it to a network before it can be used.  
  
CAUTION: SETTING A DEVICE TO A FACTORY DEFAULT DOES NOT EXCLUDE THAT DEVICE FROM A NETWORK. THE EXCLUSION PROCEDURE MUST STILL BE FOLLOWED TO REMOVE THE DEVICE FROM THE PRIMARY CONTROLLER’S INFORMATION TABLE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN A SYSTEM THAT IS SLOW TO RESPOND, OR MAY FAIL TO RESPOND TO SOME DEVICES.
