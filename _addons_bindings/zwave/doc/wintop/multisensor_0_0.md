# Multisensor Multi-sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *Multisensor*, manufactured by *Wintop* with the thing type UID of ```wintop_multisensor_00_000```.

The Multisensor supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The Multisensor does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The Multisensor does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Multisensor -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |
| Sensor (temperature) 1 | sensor_temperature1 | Temperature | Number | 
| Sensor (luminance) 2 | sensor_luminance2 | Temperature | Number | 

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Sensor (temperature) 1

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature1``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (luminance) 2

Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance2``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the Multisensor.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Set to default | Set all config values to default values (factory settings). |
| 2 | Mode Timeout | The time used in mode 2 to turn the sensor off . |
| 3 | Switch off time | Switch off time starts after timeout. |
| 4 | Sensitivity | The sensitivity of the motion circuit |
| 5 | Mode | The mode that is entered after detection |
| 6 | The temperature offset | An offset for the temperature. |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Set to default

Set all config values to default values (factory settings).

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Mode Timeout

The time used in mode 2 to turn the sensor off .
The time used in mode 2 to turn the sensor off .

This Time will start running as soon as detection is seen.
Values in the range 0 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```900```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Switch off time

Switch off time starts after timeout.
The switch off time will start running as soon as mode timeout is done. Motion sensor is turned on and when movement is de tected again the mode timeout (cfg param 1) will start running all over again. When switch off time is done a basic off message is s
Values in the range 0 to 7200 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2700```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Sensitivity

The sensitivity of the motion circuit

Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```80```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Mode

The mode that is entered after detection
Normal operation mode is default.
Values in the range 1 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: The temperature offset

An offset for the temperature.
Param1,2: A signed integer to determine the offset off the temperature.
Values in the range -10 to 10 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Multisensor supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.
