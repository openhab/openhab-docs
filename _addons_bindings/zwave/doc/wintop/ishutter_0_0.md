Button close click will still work (if button operations are not disabled). Note that Dim Down command will still begin close motion.
The following option values may be configured -:

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The iShutter supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Click, press and hold of up/down buttons

Click, press and hold of up/down buttons
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2:  Send Reports on blind state change

Send Reports on blind state change
This group supports 10 nodes.
