The DHS-WIN-BLW-DHS supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The DHS Z-Wave AC Motor Shutter Controller DHS-WIN-BLW-DHS is Z-Wave Shutter device specifically designed for use in smart homes and offices.

The product allows to operate roller blinds/shutters wirelessly using a Z-wave enabled (AUS/NZ version 921.42 MHz) controllers (compatible universal remote controllers, control panels, gateways, PC with Z-Wave USB dongle) or manually via connected manual switch.

The shutter controller can act as a wireless repeater to ensure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful to eliminate “RF deadspots” when the radio range of the Z-Wave network is influenced. This function is part of the Z-Wave network functionality and is set up via Z-Wave controller.

### Inclusion Information

1. Connect the Z-Wave Shutter Controller to the motor, power circuits and to the manual switches as per instructions in the section INSTALLATION above.
2. When the Shutter Controller is not yet included in a Z-Wave network, NWI works for 30 seconds when the Shutter Controller is power ON. Make sure your Z-Wave Gateway is in the correct operating mode (inclusion). To include/exclude press 5 times any connected buttons. During the whole procedure controller (Gateway) and Z-Wave Shutter Controller must be in close proximity of 3 m. Successful inclusion will be indicated by your Z-Wave remote controller (Gateway). In case inclusion was not successful, try the procedure again or reset network settings by running exclusion procedure (see below).
3. Once the Z-Wave Shutter Controller has been added into your Z-Wave home network successfully, you may need to assign it to a speciö c button on your controller (Gateway). Refer to your Z-Wave controller (Gateway) / panel for instructions on how to do this.
4. Now, you can control your lamp via your Z-Wave Gateway or other controller

### Exclusion Information

1. Install Connect the Z-Wave Shutter Controller to the load, power circuits and to the manual switch as per instructions in the section INSTALLATION above.
2. Start exclusion procedure on your controller and when requested press and release any connected button 5 times. During the whole procedure the controller and Z-Wave Shutter Controller must be close proximity of not more then 3 m.
3. Successful exclusion will be indicated by your Z-Wave remote controller. LED on the Z-Wave Shutter Controller will start slow blinking. In case exclusion was not successful, try the procedure again.
