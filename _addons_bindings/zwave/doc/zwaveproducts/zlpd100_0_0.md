The ZL-PD-100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Plug-in lamp control module with dimmer, supporting incandescent, LED, and CFL bulbs. 

### Inclusion Information

  1. Place your network controller into inclusion mode.
  2. When the controller is ready, single click the button on the front of the PD-100.
  3. The controller should indicate that the new device was added successfully.

If the controller shows it was a fail, repeat the procedure. 

Note: If inclusion still failed after the 2nd attempt, you need to first reset the PD-100 before repeating the above step. The manual reset method is as follows:

  1. Unplug the PD-100 from the AC outlet and also unplug the power plugs of the lighting from the module (if plugged in).
  2. Press and hold the button on the PD-100.
  3. Plug the PD-100 back into the AC outlet with the button pressed. After 3 seconds, release the button. If you see the button blink, that means that the PD-100 has been reset successfully and you may retry Step 3 above to add the module into your network. Otherwise, please repeat the manual reset procedures.

### Exclusion Information

Note: If PD-100 was previously Added (Included) in your network, resetting it locally does not mean it has been removed from your network. If you wish to remove PD-100 from your network you will need to Delete (Exclude) the module from the network by your controller.

Use the manual reset procedure only in the event that the network primary controller is lost or otherwise inoperable. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZL-PD-100 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZL-PD-100.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Nightlight | Controls LED operation |
| 9 | Dimming Resolution Level | Steps to change dimmer level per tick |
| 10 | Dimming Resolution Speed | Tick length in 10ms units |

### Parameter 3: Nightlight

Controls LED operation
When value = 0, the LED indicator will be OFF when the connected appliance is ON, and the LED indicator will be ON when the connected appliance is OFF. If value = 1, the LED indicator will be OFF when the connected appliance is OFF, and the LED indicator will be ON when the connected appliance is ON. If value = 2, the LED indicator will be always OFF regardless of the load status.
Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Dimming Resolution Level

Steps to change dimmer level per tick
Indicates the number of levels the lighting will change when the timer runs out.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Dimming Resolution Speed

Tick length in 10ms units
Indicates the time duration of each level. The resolution is 10 ms. For example, a default value of 3 means the timer runs out every 30 milliseconds. Using the combinations of these 2 parameters, you can create a dim rate adjustment range as short as 10 ms to a very slow dim rate. 
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZL-PD-100 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Association:

1. PD-100 supports group #1 for lifeline communication.

2. PD-100 supports a maximum of 1 node for group #1.

3. Lifeline association only supports the "manual reset" event.

4. For instructions on how to "set lifeline associate," please refer to your wireless controller instructions.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
