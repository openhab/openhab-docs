The SCSC-17 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Mains Operated Programmable Room Thermostat

### Inclusion Information

  * On the C-Stat programmable stat, go to Zwave Menu
  * Press INCLUDE/NODE RECEIVER

### Exclusion Information

### Wakeup Information

The SCSC-17 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Thermostat mode | thermostat_mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Operating State | thermostat_state | thermostat_state | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat mode
Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel is of type ```thermostat_mode``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |

### Operating State
Sets the thermostat operating state.

The ```thermostat_state``` channel is of type ```thermostat_state``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Idle |
| 1 | Heating |
| 2 | Cooling |
| 3 | Fan Only |
| 4 | Pending Heat |
| 5 | Pending Cool |
| 6 | Vent / Economiser |

### Setpoint (heating)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the SCSC-17.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature Scale | Controls the temperature sensor scale |
| 2 | Lower temperature limit | Defines the minimum temperature. Steps are 1C |
| 3 | Upper temperature limit | Defines the maximum temperature. Steps are 1C |
| 4 | Delta T | Defines the temperature steps of the heating control |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Temperature Scale

Controls the temperature sensor scale

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Celsius |
| 255 | Kelvin |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Lower temperature limit

Defines the minimum temperature. Steps are 1C

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Upper temperature limit

Defines the maximum temperature. Steps are 1C

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Delta T

Defines the temperature steps of the heating control
Defines the temperature steps of the heating control value is 0.1 °С.

0.1 ̊C / ̊F - 50 0.1 ̊C / ̊F
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SCSC-17 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Control


Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
