The S123A00R supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The S123A00R is a single element Z-Wave electricity meter that can provide residential customers with detailed energy data for electricity usage.

### Inclusion Information

With the meter in installer mode the following procedure needs to be carried out with the third party controller in network include mode to add the meter to its network.

  1. Press and hold the blue button for 2 seconds (enters Installer Displays).
  2. Cycle through each menu display item with single presses until the display shows “LEArn”. Do not press the blue button again unless repeating the process.
  3. Wait 10s and the display will show “oooo” for one second.
  4. Display will now show either “SENT” or “FAIL” (if “FAIL” wait for 30s and retry from point 2). Note if it is still not possible to obtain the “SENT” message then the meter should be powered down briefly and powered up again.

On entering this mode there is a 2 minute window to do the include or exclude process. The success of the action is indicated by a brief “PASS” or “FAIL” message on the meter’s display. A timeout will be indicated by a brief “FAIL” message. 

### Exclusion Information

With the meter in installer mode the following procedure needs to be carried out with the third party controller in network exclude mode to remove the meter from its network. 

  1. Press and hold the blue button for 2 seconds (enters Installer Displays). 
  2. Cycle through each menu display item with single presses until the display shows “LEArn”. Do not press the blue button again unless repeating the process. 
  3. Wait 10s and the display will show “oooo” for one second. 
  4. Display will now show either “SENT” or “FAIL” (if “FAIL” wait for 30s and retry from point 2). Note if it is still not possible to obtain the “SENT” message then the meter should be powered down briefly and powered up again.

The following table summarises the channels available for the S123A00R -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (power) | sensor_power | sensor_power | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 

### Sensor (power)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```sensor_power``` channel is of type ```sensor_power``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.
