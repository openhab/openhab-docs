The SWM301 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SWM301 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

SWM 301 is a battery-powered RF module using Z-Wave® technology for reporting secondary water metering readings in domestic dwellings.

The RF module records the meter reading by backlash-free pick-up on the litre wheel of the meter register and transmits the data over the Zwave network either on a time or delta change.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Put network controller in Inclusion / Exclusion mode.
  2. Hold a small magnet near to reed switch until the LED is turned on. Remove magnet right away when LED turned on. LED will remain on for next 4 seconds and then it will flash once to indicate NIF is sent.
  3. Repeat the step 2 if LED is not flashed once.
  4. The controller will indicate the successful inclusion/ exclusion operation.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put network controller in Inclusion / Exclusion mode.
  2. Hold a small magnet near to reed switch until the LED is turned on. Remove magnet right away when LED turned on. LED will remain on for next 4 seconds and then it will flash once to indicate NIF is sent.
  3. Repeat the step 2 if LED is not flashed once.
  4. The controller will indicate the successful inclusion/ exclusion operation.

### Wakeup Information

The SWM301 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Hold a small magnet near to reed switch until the LED is turned on. Remove magnet right away when LED turned on. LED will remain on for next 4 seconds and then it will flash once to indicate NIF is sent.

SWM301 will wake up for 10 seconds after sending NIF

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the SWM301.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Meter register offset | current meter reading |
| 2 | Meter reading reporting intervals | how often meter reading is sent |
| 3 | Delta config for meter reading | min. delta for automatic report |
| 4 | Mechanical meter serial number |  |
| 5 | Temperature monitor on / off | enable temperature monitor |
| 6 | Temperature delta | change in temperature for report |
| 7 | Temperature Alarm Threshold | temperature triggering alarm |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Meter register offset

current meter reading
Offset to adjust the reported to the actual meter reading.
Values in the range 0 to 99999999 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Meter reading reporting intervals

how often meter reading is sent
Defines how often the meter reading is sent.
Values in the range 1 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1440```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Delta config for meter reading

min. delta for automatic report
Defines the minimum change of the meter reading that results in an unsolicited meter report.
Values in the range 0 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Mechanical meter serial number



Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Temperature monitor on / off

Defines below what temperature a low temperature alarm is reported.
Values in the range 0 to 40 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SWM301 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Meter reading

Group receiving meter readings
Group 1 - Nodes to receive unsolicited water meter reading.

Association group 1 supports 2 nodes.
