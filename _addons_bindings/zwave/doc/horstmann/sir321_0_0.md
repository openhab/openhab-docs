The SIR-321 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Wirelessly controllable 3 KW wall switch timer function

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SIR-321 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Temperature

 This is what is generated in the zwave node file: <commandClass>SENSOR\_MULTILEVEL</commandClass> <multiLevelSensorCommandClass> <version>1</version> <instances>1</instances> <versionSupported>1</versionSupported> <sensors> <entry> <multilevelSensorType>TEMPERATURE</multilevelSensorType> <multilevelSensor> <sensorType>TEMPERATURE</sensorType> <initialised>true</initialised> </multilevelSensor> </entry> </sensors> <isGetSupported>true</isGetSupported> </multiLevelSensorCommandClass>

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the SIR-321.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Fail Save timer | Enable/Disable the Fail save timer |
| 2 | Temperature Scale | Set the Temperatur scale to Celsius |
| 3 | Temperature reporting intervals | Define the time interval for the temperature report that is sent. |
| 4 | Delta configuration temperature reporting | Set the delta-configuration of the temperature report in Celsius or Fahrenheit |
| 5 | Temperature Cutoff | Set the Cutoff in Celsius |

### Parameter 1: Fail Save timer

Enable/Disable the Fail save timer

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature Scale

Set the Temperatur scale to Celsius

Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Temperature reporting intervals

Define the time interval for the temperature report that is sent.

Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Delta configuration temperature reporting

Set the delta-configuration of the temperature report in Celsius or Fahrenheit

Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Temperature Cutoff

Set the Cutoff in Celsius

Values in the range 0 to 1000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SIR-321 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Group 1
This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2
This group supports 4 nodes.
