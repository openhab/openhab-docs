The SRT323 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SRT323 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SRT323 has been developed to control central heating systems where the demand temperature can be set locally or remotely by a third party device. The SRT323 also has the capability to act as a temperature sensor

### Inclusion Information

Set DIL switch 1 to ’ON’ position on the back of the unit, scroll through the function menu by rotating the dial until **L** is displayed

Once the character starts flashing the installer has 60 sec to activate the 3rd party unit. Once the 3rd party unit has been activated the process must be completed within 240 sec or SRT323 will timeout. Preferably, start the process to add a node from the controller then press the dial of the SRT323

### Exclusion Information

Not Provided

### Wakeup Information

The SRT323 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SRT323 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Thermostat mode | thermostat_mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Operating State | thermostat_state | thermostat_state | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat mode
Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel is of type ```thermostat_mode``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |

### Operating State
Sets the thermostat operating state.

The ```thermostat_state``` channel is of type ```thermostat_state``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Idle |
| 1 | Heating |
| 2 | Cooling |
| 3 | Fan Only |
| 4 | Pending Heat |
| 5 | Pending Cool |
| 6 | Vent / Economiser |

### Setpoint (heating)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the SRT323.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature Sensor | Disable or enable temperature sensor |
| 2 | Temperature Scale | Temperature Scale |
| 3 | Delta T | Define the temperature steps |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Temperature Sensor

Disable or enable temperature sensor

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 255 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature Scale

Temperature Scale

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Celsius |
| 255 | Fahrenheit |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Celsius).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Delta T

Define the temperature steps
Change between temperatures to trigger a temperature report (step 0.1) (Default 10 = 1C)
Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SRT323 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Thermostat Operating State reports


Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: Low Battery Warnings


Association group 3 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 4: Thermostat Set Point Reports


Association group 4 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 5: Multilevel Sensor Reports


Association group 5 supports 4 nodes.
