The SSR-302 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SSR-302 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

SSR302 is a three-ampere Z-Wave relay switch designed to fit on an industry standard 6-pin wall plate, and is an ideal replacement for traditional wired heating controls.  It is a two-channel switching unit that is well matched for use with systems that require separate channels for heating and hot water.

SSR302 is easy to integrate with other devices using the interoperable Z-Wave standard, and is suitable for applications that require low-power remote switching for two channels. A tri-colour LED gives clear indication of the switch and network status. Switches on the front fascia provide local control, with tactile feedback.

Fully integrated with our own products and running on the interoperable Z-wave standard this is an ideal candidate for applications where 2 channel low power remote switching is required. The tri-colour LED gives clear indication of switch states, while four tactile buttons, concealed behind a flap on the front fascia, provide local control.  https://www.securemeters.com/index.php/products/residential/home-heating-hot-water-controls/actuators/ssr/    Application 

  * **Boiler and hot water control    ** 
    
    SSR302 is ideal for boiler control for heating and hot water when used together with a **_SRT321_** room thermostat. Manual on and off buttons on the front panel provide local override functionality.

### Key Feature

  *   * Mains-powered boiler switch
      * 2 channels, 3-ampere rated
      * Acts a Z-Wave<sup>® </sup>repeater, to extend range and signal coverage
      * Switched live or switched circuit operation
      * Switch status indication
      * Manual on/off operation

### Inclusion Information

To connect the unit to a 3rd party controller follow these steps, also known as ‘inclusion’ in Z-Wave terminology.  
- Ensure the LED is flashing RED on the SSR302, if not follow the steps in ‘Disconnecting from a network’ first.  
- Put the 3rd party controller into inclusion mode.  
- Press and hold both white buttons on the SSR302 until the LED starts flashing green.  
- The SSR302 has been included onto the network and the LED will go solid amber.

  
NOTE: If the LED does not flash green, the include process has been unsuccessful.

### Exclusion Information

To disconnect from a Z-wave network, follow the steps below, also known as ‘exclusion’ in Z-Wave terminology.  
- Put the 3rd party controller into exclusion mode.  
- Press and hold the two white buttons on the SSR302.  
- The SSR302 has been excluded from the network when the LED starts flashing red.

NOTE: If the Network LED does not flash the exclude.

### Wakeup Information

The SSR-302 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Pressing and holding the two white buttons for 1 second will trigger the SSR302 to issue a Node Information Frame and enter learn mode for 1 second. This is useful when to associate / disassociate the SSR302 with a control group or just to determine the device and command classes supported. This can be done at any time but will not provide any indication to the operator.

### General Usage Information

The unit supports two static end points for the two channels.

  
Pressing the Top White button for 1 second will issue an ‘end point capability report’ for channel 1.

  
Pressing the Bottom White button for 1 second will issue an ‘end point capability report’ for channel 2.

  
Broadcasting in this manner has been implemented to support association of a channel with a 3rd party controller that supports Multi-Channel Command Class.
