# SSR-302 Two Channel Boiler Actuator
This describes the Z-Wave device *SSR-302*, manufactured by *Horstmann Controls Limited* with the thing type UID of ```horstmann_ssr302_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *HVAC*, defining Air condition devices, Fans.

The SSR-302 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SSR-302 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
