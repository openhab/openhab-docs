The SES 303 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SES 303 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The SES 303 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SES 303 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)

Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the SES 303.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Delta Temp | Precision of measured temperature (delta) |
| 2 | Temp Reporting Interval | Reporting interval in minutes |
| 3 | Delta Humidity | Precision of measured humidity (delta) |
| 4 | Humidity Reporting Interval | Reporting interval in minutes |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Delta Temp

Precision of measured temperature (delta)
Configuration value : Desired value / Resolution. (Resolution = 0.1)

**Example**: To configure Delta temperature to 2 °C, the value needed to be configured in device is 2/0.1 = 20.

  
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temp Reporting Interval

Reporting interval in minutes
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Delta Humidity

Precision of measured humidity (delta)
Configuration value : Desired value / Resolution. (Resolution = 0.1)

**Example**: To configure Delta temperature to 2 °C, the value needed to be configured in device is 2/0.1 = 20.

**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Humidity Reporting Interval

Reporting interval in minutes
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.

Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
