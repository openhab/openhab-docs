The SES 303 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SES 303 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Environmental Sensor (SES 303) measures temperature and humidity. The sensors are battery-operated devices which transmit information to an associated device in a network. It can support either 1 thermistor (SES 001) or up to 4 external digital temperature sensors (SES 002/003). SES 303 operates on 2x AA batteries, providing a nominal life of 2 years (with on-board sensors operating with the default configuration).

### Inclusion Information

On the SES 303, press the button, hold and release after 1 second to send a request (Network Information Frame) to join the network.

On successful inclusion the LED will flash 2 times. The total process can take up to 20 seconds. If the LED flashes 4-times this means that the inclusion process has failed, so try moving the SES 303 to another position and repeat the Inclusion steps. If the inclusion process fails again, the device may be already included in another network. So first exclude and then include the device. The controller will show when the inclusion operation is successful.

### Exclusion Information

On the SES 303, press the button, hold and release after 1 second to send a request (Network Information Frame) to remove from the network.

On successful exclusion the LED will flash 2 times. The total process can take up to 2 seconds. If the LED flashes 4-times this means that the exclusion process has failed, so try moving the SES 303 to another position and repeat the exclusion steps. The controller will show when the exclusion operation is successful.

### Wakeup Information

The SES 303 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Device can be wakeup by button press of more then one second, devcie will stay in wakeup state for about 10 seconds

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SES 303 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the SES 303.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Delta Temp | Precision of measured temperature (delta) |
| 2 | Temp Reporting Interval | Reporting interval in minutes |
| 3 | Delta Humidity | Precision of measured humidity (delta) |
| 4 | Humidity Reporting Interval | Reporting interval in minutes |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Delta Temp

Precision of measured temperature (delta)
Configuration value : Desired value / Resolution. (Resolution = 0.1)

**Example**: To configure Delta temperature to 2 °C,  the value needed to be configured in device is 2/0.1 = 20.

  
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.  
  


Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temp Reporting Interval

Reporting interval in minutes
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.  
  


Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Delta Humidity

Precision of measured humidity (delta)
Configuration value : Desired value / Resolution. (Resolution = 0.1)

**Example**: To configure Delta temperature to 2 °C,  the value needed to be configured in device is 2/0.1 = 20.

**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.  
  


Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Humidity Reporting Interval

Reporting interval in minutes
**IMPORTANT**: Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255, the value sent in the application shall be equal to desired value minus 256. For example, to set Delta Temperature to 130, it may be needed to set a value 130−256=−126.  
  


Zero configuration means that the corresponding functionality is disabled.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SES 303 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline, in which multilevel sensor report, Battery low alarm are reported. Each endpoint supports 1 association group.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
