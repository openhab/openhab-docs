The LC-13 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The LC-13 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This is a Z-Wave controlled electronic radiator thermostat by Danfoss. It is controlled by either a Z-Wave compatible controller or a central device called Danfoss LinkTM CC. It uses Z-Wave wireless communication technology, is easy to install and is supplied with adaptors for all thermostatic valves manufactured by Danfoss and most other radiator valve manufacturers.

It is battery powered, compact and very easy to operate with only three buttons on the front.

**Technical Features**

- Easy to operate - only three buttons
- Open window function
- Valve exercise function
- PID control (precise control)
- Adaptive learning
- Weekly programs with adjustable temperature set-backs
- Battery lifetime 2 years
- Min./max. temp. limitation
- Child lock
- Holiday/away function

To reset the device, you have to take the batteries out, hold the button, put the batteries back in and continue holding the button for > 5 s for the device to reset.

### Wakeup Information

The LC-13 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the LC-13 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | Temperature | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | Temperature | Number | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 

### Setpoint (heating)

Sets the thermostate setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Clock Time Offset

Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Alarm (general)

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters configured.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LC-13 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Target for Wakeup and Override Notifications


This group supports 1 nodes.
