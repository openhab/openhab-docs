The ZW141 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeotec Nano Shutter is a Z-Wave motor controller specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (up/down/stop) for existing window covering motors. It can connect to 2 external manual switches/buttons to control the motor up/down/stop independently.

Its surface has a pin socket, which can be used for connecting to the touch panel, so you can also use the touch panel to control the Nano Shutter.

The wireless module is powered from the mains supply. In the event of power failure, non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the units operating status.  Nano Shutter is also a security Z-Wave plus device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the products firmware upgrade.

It can be a repeater in the Z-Wave network. Acting as a bridge for communication, it will forward Z-Wave command messages to their destinations if the originating controller is out of range from the destination node. 

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into pairing mode.
  2. Press the Action Button on the Nano Dimmer or toggle the external manual switch once, the green LED (non-secure indication) will blink to indicate the Nano Dimmer is entering into pairing mode.
  3. If the Nano Dimmer has been successfully added to your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will be solid. If the pairing was unsuccessful, the red LED will be on for 2 seconds and then remain a colourful gradient, repeat the instructions above from step 1.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set your Z-Wave controller into removal mode.
  2. Press the Action Button 6 times on the Nano Dimmer or toggle the external manual switch 2 times in fast succession.
  3. If the Nano Dimmer has been successfully removed from your Z-Wave network, its RGB LED will remain colourful gradient. If the removal was unsuccessful, the RGB LED will still be solid (following the state of the output load), repeat the instructions above from step 1.

### General Usage Information

Controlling the Nano Shutter.

  * Use any of the below methods to control the Nano Shutter.
  * Pressing the button on the external (Wall) switch will be able to spin the motor up/down/stop through the usage of Z-Wave commands built into Z-Wave certified controllers and gateways (The specific Z-Wave commands supporting this function are the Basic Command Class and Multilevel Switch Command Class.) Please consult the operation manual for these controllers for specific instructions on controlling the Motor Controller.
  * A short press on the button on the Motor Controller will spin the motor up/down/stop.
  * Change Mode on the External Switch/Button Control.
  * Nano Shutter by default is set to be controlled via 2-state (flip/flop) external wall switch.
  * Pushing the button 6 times in quick succession on the Nano Shutter will swap between this default mode and the momentary push button external wall switch mode

Reset your Nano Shutter

  * If at some stage, your primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Nano Shutter’s settings to their factory defaults. To do this, press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds and then release it. Your Nano Shutter will now be reset to its original settings, and the green LED will be solid for 2 seconds and then remain the colourful gradient status as a confirmation.

### Parameter 35: Moving time left to right

Set the moving time from up (left) to down (right) for curtain.

Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_35_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 80: Report sent to nodes in association group 1

Report sent to associated nodes in association group 1

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW141 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
When the state of Nano Shutter (turn on/off the load ) is changed:

  1. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 0: Send nothing (default). 
  2. Set Configuration parameter 80 to 1: Send the Basic Report.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Forward the Basic Set, Binary set, Scene Activation Set to associated nodes in Group 2 when the Nano Shutter receives the Basic Set, Binary set, Scene Activation Set commands from main controller. (E.g. Send/forward Basic Set to control the other nodes in association Group 2)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
