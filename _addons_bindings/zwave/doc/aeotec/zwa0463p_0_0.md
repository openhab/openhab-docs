The ZWA046-3P supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Aeotec Home Energy Meter is an energy meter for the entire home. It can wirelessly report instantaneous Power, KWH, Voltage and Amperage measurements to Z-Wave® gateway/controller. It can send Z-Wave REPORTS at any time when it receives Z-Wave Get Commands.

The HEM can be setup to send automatic reports to any associated nodes in association group 1 at an interval time It can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave/ Z-Wave Plus® certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. The device supports the Z-Wave Security S2 framework with authenticated and unauthenticated network keys. Please follow the instructions on the central controller when including. The device also supports SmartStart. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product’s firmware upgrade. As soon as the HEM is removed from a Z-Wave network it will be reset to default factory settings.

### Inclusion Information

The following will step you through adding the product to your Z-Wave network.

Fix Back-Mount Plate to the selected position with the provided screws. The plate should be installed vertically to make sure the connected cables naturally hanging and to fully ensure that the IP44 weatherized rating applies.

Set your Z-Wave gateway into its ‘add device’ mode in order to connect Home Energy Meter to your Z-Wave system. Refer to the gateway’s manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.

Press Action Button on the back of main body; its LED will flash blue rapidly to indicate it has entered pair mode.

When Home Energy Meter successfully joins your Z-Wave network its LED will flash blue for several seconds and then turn solid blue. Should the LED keep blinking blue, it has been unable to join your Z-Wave network; repeat the above steps and please contact us for further support if needed.

Attach the main body to Back-Mount Plate.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA046-3P supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Root

Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
