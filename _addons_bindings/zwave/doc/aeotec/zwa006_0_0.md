## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA006 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 is lifeline group, all nodes which associated in this group will receive the messages sent by device through lifeline.


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/off

COMMAND\_CLASS\_BASIC/BASIC_SET
Group 2 is a basic group, all nodes which associated in this group will receive a basic set command sent by this group. When the device is on, a basic set command with 0xFF value will be sent. When the device is off, a basic set command with 0x00 value will be sent.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
