## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW164 supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  * Device Reset Locally Notification: Issued when Factory Reset is performed .
  * Sound Switch Tone Play Report: Issued when a tone has started playing .
  * Sound Switch Configuration Report : Issued when volume or default tone has changed.
  * Notification Report (Type=0x0E; Event=0x01): Issued when Chime starts playing tone.
  * Notification Report (Type=0x0E; Event=0x00): Issued when Chime stops playing tone.
  * Notification Report (Type=0x07; Event=0x09): Issued when Chime is tampered and moved.
  * Notification Report (Type=0x08 ; Event=0x0A): Issued when Button is low battery.
  * Notification Report (Type=0x0 8; Event=0x00): Issued when Button comes back to normal battery.
  * Configuration Report (Parameter=0x32): Issued when Pairing Button Mode is trig gered .
  * Configuration Report (Parameter=0x33): Issued when Unpairing or Pairing Button Mode finishes .
