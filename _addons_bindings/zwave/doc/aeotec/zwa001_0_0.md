## Overview

Standard form factor and appearance of the light bulb with 800 lm output Tunable white: dimmable from 5% to 100%, tunable from 2700K to 6500K. Possible to be included in groups, scenes, or schedules Suitable for indoor lighting: Corridors, Bedroom, Living Room, etc.

Reset the device :

  * Please use this procedure only when the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.
  * Led bulb re-power 6 times (between 0.5-2 seconds each time); If the 6th power on, the led bulb flashes twice, which means that the resetting is successful.

### Inclusion Information

Add for inclusion:

  * Set the Z-Wave network main controller into adding mode.
  * Power cycle once for led bulb(OFF->ON).The led bulb will flash twice and send node info frame.
  * Wait a moment, the led bulb should be added to the controller.Then the led bulb will flash once when it has been included into the network.

### Exclusion Information

Remove for exclusion:

  * Set the Z-Wave network main controller into removing mode.
  * Led bulb re-power 3 times (between 0.5-2 seconds each time).
  * Wait a moment, the led bulb should be removed from the controller.Then the led bulb will flash once, dim to 5% first, and then increased to 100% after 5 seconds.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZWA001 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
