## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SR-ZV9092A supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
1. Send Command Class **DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION** to associated devices of this group when factory reset the device.

2. Send Command Class **THERMOSTAT\_SETPOINT\_REPORT**, **THERMOSTAT\_MODE\_REPORT**, **THERMOSTAT\_OPERATING\_STATE_REPORT** to associated devices of this group when operation mode and temperature change.

3 .Send Command Class **NOTIFICATION_REPORT** to associated devices of this group when overcurrent or overheat detected.

4. Send Command Class **METER_REPORT** to associated devices of this group to report metering parameters.

Profile: AGI\_LIFE\_LINE (0x0001)

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: HeatSet

Heat set
Transfer Command Class **THERMOSTAT\_SETPOINT\_SET**, **THERMOSTAT\_MODE\_SET** to control other temperature control devices when operation changes.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
