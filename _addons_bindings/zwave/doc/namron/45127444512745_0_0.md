## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4512744 / 4512745 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1.Send Command Class DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY\_NOTIFICATION to associated devices of this group when factory reset the device. 2.Send Command Class THERMOSTAT\_SETPOINT\_REPORT, THERMOSTAT\_MODE\_REPORT, THERMOSTAT\_OPERATING\_STATE\_REPORT to associated devices of t

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Heat Set

Transfer Command Class THERMOSTAT\_SETPOINT\_SET THERMOSTAT\_MODE\_SET to control other temperature control devices when operation changes

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
