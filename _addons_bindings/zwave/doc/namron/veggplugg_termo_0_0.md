## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4512725 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
1. Smart plug Factory Reset, send Command Class **Device Reset Locally Notification** to associated devices of this group to report factory reset information when factory reset the smart plug.

2. Smart plug over current, over temperature, send Command Class **NOTIFICATION_REPORT** to associated devices of this group to report overload information.

3. When smart plug state changes, send Command Class **SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT** to associated devices of this group to report state information.

4. **METER_REPORT.**

5. Send **SENSOR\_MULTILEVEL\_REPORT** to report temperature.

6. Report when thermostat setpoint or mode changes.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
