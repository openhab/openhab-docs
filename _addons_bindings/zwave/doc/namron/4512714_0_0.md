The 4512714/ZV9001K8 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 4512714/ZV9001K8 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

**Product Description**

The remote control is a Z-Wave device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate scenes in Gateways. Although it is controlling other devices. the device Cannot act as Z-Wave network controller (primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. It also supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.

The remote control has following functions:

  1. Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON'. 'OFF' and Dim commands.
  2. Activation of scenes in Gateway mode.

The encryption modes that the remote control supports are SO, S2 Authenticated, S2 Unauthenticated. When the remote control is being included into a Z-Wave network, you can use your primary controller/gateway to enable one encryption mode or disable encryption. (The primary controller/gateway shall support encryption mode configuration).

### Inclusion Information

Inclusion (Adding to a Z-Wave network)

Step 1. Make sure the remote control does not belong to any Z-Wave network. Short press any button. If LED indicator does not turn on. the remote control does not belong to any network. then continue step 2. If LED indicator turns on, it means the remote control has already been included to a network. Please first set the remote control to exclusion mode (refer to the part 'Exclusion' of this manual), then continue step 2.

Step 2. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion).

Step 3. Press and hold down both buttons I and 0 of Group 2 over 3 seconds. LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to inclusion mode, and waiting to be included, after 10 sconds LED indicator blinks 6 times quickly to indicate successful inclusion. The remote control is a sleepy device, after inclusion it will not enter into sleepy mode immediately, and will continue activation status for 30s and wait data interaction from the gateway. the LED indicator will stay solid on, please be patient to wait LED indicator to turn off.

### Exclusion Information

**Exclusion (Removing from a Z-Wave network)**

There are two exclusion methods:

**Method 1:** Exclusion from the primary controller/gateway as follows:

1. Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).

2. Press and hold down both buttons I and 0 of Group 2 over 3 seconds. LED indicator turns on, the remote control will be set to exclusion mode. and waiting to be excluded, after 7s LED indicator blinks 4 times quickly to indicate successful exclusion.

**Method 2:** Factory reset the remote control will force the remote control to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part 'Factory Reset' of this manual)

Note: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

**Factory Reset**

Press and hold down both buttons I and 0 of Group 2 for over 10 seconds. LED indicator turns on and then blinks 4 times quickly to indicate successful factory reset.

### Wakeup Information

The 4512714/ZV9001K8 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press any button to wake the controller

### General Usage Information

**Set and unset associations:**

(Note: All association information will be cleared automatically once the remote control is excluded from a network.)

There are two methods to set associations:

1. Set association by operating primary controller/gateway to send association command to the remote control

When set association from primary controller/gateway, the remote control shall be activated first, if it is not activated. you should activate it manually.

The primary controller/gateway sends association command to the remote control using 'Command Class ASSOCIATION' or 'Command Class Multi ChannelAssociation'

2. Set association by operating the remote control and devices to be controlled:

To control a Z-Wave device from the remote control, the node ID of this device needs to be assigned to one of the two association groups. This is a three-step process:

1. Press and hold down both buttons I and 0 of Group 2 over 3 seconds. LED indicator turns on.

2. Short press ON button of any group within 7s to associate the device to this group, short press OFF button 01 any group within 7s to remove association of the device from this group.

3. Operate the device to be controlled to send Node Information Frame (please refer to the device manual) within 10 seconds. or set the device to exclusion mode within 10 seconds. since It will send Node Information _Frame in exclusion mode, LED indications are as follows:

Now to communicate with the device

The remote control is under sleepy mode for most of the time to save battery power. It can not receive wireless command under sleepy mode. Before the gateway interacts data with the remote. the remote control shall be activated manually first. Short press any button to activate the remote control for 3s. and press and hold down I and 0 buttons of Group 2 over 1 second to activate the remote control for Ts.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 4512714/ZV9001K8 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |

| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the 4512714/ZV9001K8.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Factory Reset | Factory Reset |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Factory Reset

Factory Reset
21930=Factory ResetThis is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 21930 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4512714/ZV9001K8 supports 5 association groups.
