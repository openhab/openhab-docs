The 4512710 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Z-wave in-wall dimmer.  400W 1 channel.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set primary controller/gateway into inclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion)
  2. Power on the In-wall dimmer and set it into inclusion mode. There are ttwo methods to set the In-wall dimmer into inclusion mode: 
      1. Repower on the dimmer, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.
      2. Triple press the action button on the dimmer, it will set the dimmer into inclusion mode.

The connected light will stay on for 3 seconds to indicate successful inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

There are two exclusion methods:

Method 1:

  1. Set primarry controller/gateway into exclusion mode(Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into exclusion)
  2. Triple press the action button on the dimmer, the dimmer will be set to exclusion mode, and waiting to be excluded, then the dimmer will be excluded from the network.

Method 2:

Factory reset the dimmer will force the dimmer to be excluded.

Factory reset:

  * Press and hold down the action button for over 10 seconds, the dimmer will be reset to factory defaults. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 4512710 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Alarm (system) | alarm_system | alarm_system |  | Switch | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Alarm (system)
Indicates if a system alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_system``` channel is of type ```alarm_system``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 4512710 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
  1. When factory reset the dimmer, send "Device Reset Locally Notification CC" to associated of this group report factory reset information.
  2. When load state changes, send "Basic Report CC" to associated devices of this group.
  3. When a load malfunction is detected, send "Emergency shutoff status" to Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
