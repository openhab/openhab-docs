The SP816 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SP816 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The SP816 Outdoor Motion Detector is a Z-Wave PlusTM enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network.

The device can be set up in a Z-wave network to communicate directly with other end devices such as lighting controllers, or to report directly to a Z-wave controller (usually a gateway). This motion detector is primarily designed for outdoor lighting control application.

It features a PIR motion detector to detect movement in a protected area and a lux sensor for determining brightness of its surroundings. It comes with a built in timer to set the duration for light turn on. The lux level and the timer can be set through knobs on the device itself. If the PIR detects motion when lux level falls below a preset setting, the device will transmit a signal to turn on the outdoor lighting (or indirectly through gateway) and then later turns it off when its timer has elapsed. 

### Inclusion Information

The detector supports Auto Inclusion feature where it will automatically enter Inclusion mode when first powered up after a factory reset.

  1. Use a screwdriver to detach the rear cover.
  2. Put a Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode. Insert 3 AA-size 1.5V batteries to the battery compartment with the correct polarity. The LED on the device should turns ON.
  3. The Inclusion process should be started automatically.

Manual inclusion:

  1. Put the controller into inclusion mode
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put the controller into exclusion mode
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into exclusion mode.
  3. Within 1 second of step 1, press the tamper switch again and hold until LED is off (about 5 seconds)

### Wakeup Information

The SP816 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


For waking up please triple click the tamper switch

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the SP816.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set Level | Basic Set Level |
| 2 | Enable/Disable Detecting | The Detecting function can be Disabled or Enabled. |
| 3 | Sensitivity Level | 1 Means lowest sensitivity and 10 means highest. |
| 4 | Re-trigger Interval | Adjust the interval of being re-triggered after a trigger |
| 5 | Lux Level | Minimum Lux Level to provoke trigger |
| 6 | On-Off Duration | On-Off Duration |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set Level

Basic Set Level
When Basic Set Command is sent where contains a value, the receiver will take it for consideration; for instance, if a lamp module is received the Basic Set command of which value is decisive as to how bright of dim level of lamp module shall be.

Example: 0: OFF  
1-99: ON (Binary Switch Device)  
Dim Level (Multilevel Switch Device)  
Function: Basic Set level
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Enable/Disable Detecting

The Detecting function can be Disabled or Enabled.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Sensitivity Level

1 Means lowest sensitivity and 10 means highest.

Values in the range 1 to 10 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Re-trigger Interval

Adjust the interval of being re-triggered after a trigger
The Configuration parameter that can be used to adjust the interval of being re-triggered after the detector has been triggered as Configuration Parameter #4. No response will be made during this interval if a movement is presented. The time interval can be set between 5 secs to 3600 secs. 
Values in the range 5 to 3600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Lux Level

Minimum Lux Level to provoke trigger
Sets minimum Lux Level of ambient illumination necessary for Motion Detector to trigger.

The user can set a detecting percentage of lux level which determines when the light sensor will be activated. If percentage of lux level of ambient illumination falls below this percentage, and a person moves across or within the protected area, the detector will emit Z-Wave ON Command (i.e. Basic Set Command (Value = Basic Set Level)) to controller and activate connected modules and lighting. Percentage can be set between 1% to 100%.
Values in the range 1 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: On-Off Duration

On-Off Duration
The function of on-off duration setting will be useful if the detector is connected with a module or lighting. The duration determines how long the module/lighting should stay ON. For instance, Lamp Module turns off 100 secs after it has been turned on. This parameter can be configured with the value of 5 through 3600, where 5 means 5 second delay and 3600 means 3600 seconds of delay
Values in the range 5 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SP816 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: PIR Control

Basic Set

Association group 2 supports 3 nodes.
