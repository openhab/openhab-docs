# AN163 Metering Power Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *AN163*, manufactured by *Everspring* with the thing type UID of ```everspring_an163_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Power Outlet*, defining Small devices to be plugged into a power socket in a wall which stick there.

The AN163 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Remote On/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer’s Wireless Controller. Each module is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots

This plug-in ON/OFF Module is able to detect current wattage (5~1440W) and overload wattage of connected non-dimmable lights or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Module will be disabled and its On/Off button will be locked out of which LED will flash quickly for 30 seconds. However, unplug and re-connect the Module will reset its overload condition to normal status

### Inclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode

### Exclusion Information

Pressing On/Off button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the AN163 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (kWh)
Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel is of type ```meter_kwh``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)
Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel is of type ```meter_watts``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the AN163.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | True Period | Timeout before unit transmits ON/OFF state after manual button press |
| 2 | Send Basic Command to Group 2 | Configure the unit to send command to other devices in Grouping 2 |
| 3 | Meter Report Period (W) | How often the meter should report load (W). |
| 4 | Meter Report Period (kWh) | How often the meter should report load (kWh). |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: True Period

Timeout before unit transmits ON/OFF state after manual button press
This setting configures the timeout after the manual on/off button is pressed before the status is transmitted. When the on/off button is pressed, the timer starts. After the timeout expires, the status of the switch is examined, and if it is different than it was prior to the first button press, the updated status is transmitted. If it is the same, no status is transmitted.

The time setting is made in increments of 100ms, so a setting of "10" sets the timer to 10 * 100ms, or 1000ms (1s).
Values in the range 0 to 120 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Send Basic Command to Group 2

Configure the unit to send command to other devices in Grouping 2
If set to 0, pressing the manual on/off button or receiving a basic_set command will not send a command to other devices in grouping 2. If set to 1, the device will send a command to other devices in grouping 2.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Meter Report Period (W)

How often the meter should report load (W).
This setting configures how often the module should report instant power load (in Watts) to the controller. The maximum interval is 9h (10s * 3240 / 3600 = 9h).
Values in the range 0 to 3240 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Meter Report Period (kWh)

How often the meter should report load (kWh).
This setting configures the period for the module to report power load over time (kWh). The default is 24h. Maximum period is 1 week (1min * 10080 / 60 = 168h = 1 week). Smaller loads generally need more time for accurate calculation of kilowatt-hours. 
Values in the range 0 to 10080 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1440```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AN163 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Grouping 1

Grouping 1 reports status
 Grouping 1 includes ALARM\_REPORT, SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT, METER\_REPORT_COMMAND

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Grouping 2

Allows control of up to four other devices
 Grouping 2 includes BASIC_SET.

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
