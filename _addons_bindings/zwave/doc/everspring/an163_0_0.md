# AN163 Metering Power Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *AN163*, manufactured by *Everspring* with the thing type UID of ```everspring_an163_00_000```.

The AN163 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/492) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the AN163 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the AN163.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | True Period | Timeout before unit transmits ON/OFF state after manual button press |
| 2 | Send Basic Command to Group 2 | Configure the unit to send command to other devices in Grouping 2 |
| 3 | Meter Report Period (W) | How often the meter should report load (W). |
| 4 | Meter Report Period (kWh) | How often the meter should report load (kWh). |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: True Period

Timeout before unit transmits ON/OFF state after manual button press
This setting configures the timeout after the manual on/off button is pressed before the status is transmitted. When the on/off button is pressed, the timer starts. After the timeout expires, the status of the switch is examined, and if it is different than it was prior to the first button press, the updated status is transmitted. If it is the same, no status is transmitted.

The time setting is made in increments of 100ms, so a setting of "10" sets the timer to 10 \* 100ms, or 1000ms (1s).
Values in the range 0 to 120 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Send Basic Command to Group 2

Configure the unit to send command to other devices in Grouping 2
If set to 0, pressing the manual on/off button or receiving a basic\_set command will not send a command to other devices in grouping 2. If set to 1, the device will send a command to other devices in grouping 2.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Meter Report Period (W)

How often the meter should report load (W).
This setting configures how often the module should report instant power load (in Watts) to the controller. The maximum interval is 9h (10s \* 3240 / 3600 = 9h).
Values in the range 0 to 3240 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Meter Report Period (kWh)

How often the meter should report load (kWh).
This setting configures the period for the module to report power load over time (kWh). The default is 24h. Maximum period is 1 week (1min \* 10080 / 60 = 168h = 1 week). Smaller loads generally need more time for accurate calculation of kilowatt-hours.
Values in the range 0 to 10080 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1440```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AN163 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Grouping 1

Grouping 1 reports status
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Grouping 2

Allows control of up to four other devices
This group supports 4 nodes.
