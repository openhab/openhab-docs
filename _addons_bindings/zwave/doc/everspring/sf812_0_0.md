The SF812 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SF812 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The photoelectric Smoke Detector is a Z-WaveTM enabled device which is fully  
compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Z-WaveTM enabled devices  
displaying the Z-WaveTM logo can also be used with it regardless of the  
manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-WaveTM  
enabled networks. Inclusion of this detector on other manufacturer’s Wireless  
Controller menu allows remote operation of connected modules when the  
detector is triggered.  
The detector is designed to sense smoke that comes into the detector chamber.  
It does not sense gas, heat, or flame. The working principle is when the smoke  
detector detects a certain density of smoke, the horn of smoke detector will  
sound and in the meantime, the detector will emit the signals to the associated  
devices for further execution. It can provide precious time for you and your  
family to escape before a fire spreads.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing link key three times within 1.5 second will enter inclusion mode. The Detector will stay “awake” for 10 minutes to allow time for setting and device status enquiring.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing link key three times within 1.5 second will enter exclusion mode. The Detector will stay “awake” for 10 minutes to allow time for setting and device status enquiring.

### Wakeup Information

The SF812 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SF812 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm (tamper) | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (Low battery) | alarm_battery | alarm_battery | LowBattery | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Alarm (smoke) | alarm_smoke | alarm_smoke | Smoke | Switch | 

### Alarm (tamper)
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (Low battery)
Indicates if the low battery alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_battery``` channel is of type ```alarm_battery``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```LowBattery``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Alarm (smoke)
Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel is of type ```alarm_smoke``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Smoke``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SF812 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Alarm notifications


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
