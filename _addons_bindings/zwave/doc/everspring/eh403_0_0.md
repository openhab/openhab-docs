The EH403-3 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Small yet powerful, this slim design floodlight with PIR detector is a compact fully automatic security floodlight. Its aesthetic design makes it suitable for installation in front areas of the house typically occupied by spotlight and lanterns.  
When connected to the Z-Wave controller, the user is able to remotely turn on/off the floodlight and receive notification when the PIR detects motion.

### Inclusion Information

The unit supports Auto Inclusion feature where it will automatically enter Inclusion mode when first powered up after a factory reset.

  1. Prepare the Z-Wave controller.
  2. Plug the cable plug to the wall socket to power up the unit. WARNING: be careful not to touch any exposed wire/contacts to prevent electrical shock!
  3. The Link LED will start to blink slowly with 2-second on, 2-second off (for 2 minutes) which shows the unit does not be paired.
  4. Within 30 seconds, put the Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.
  5. The Inclusion process should be completed when the Link LED stops blinking. Note: If you are connecting this unit to a Z-Wave Controller that utilizes the S2 security protocol, you may be asked by your controller to enter a 5-digit Device Specific Key (DSK) that is unique to each unit. This can be found in one of two places: - on the QR code label on the back of the unit - on the insert card inside the packaging.
  6. Turn on the floodlight using the controller to check if the auto inclusion is working properly.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Put the Z-Wave Controller into exclusion mode.
  2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into exclusion mode

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the EH403-3 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | sensor_luminance |  | Number | 
| Motion Alarm | alarm_motion | alarm_motion | Motion | Switch | 
| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Motion Alarm
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the EH403-3.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | PIR Trigger Off period | PIR Trigger Off period |
| 2 | Lux sensor threshold | Lux sensor threshold |
| 3 | Lux auto report | Lux auto report |
| 4 | Reads back the lux level measured | Reads back the lux level measured |

### Parameter 1: PIR Trigger Off period

PIR Trigger Off period

Values in the range 8 to 720 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Lux sensor threshold

Lux sensor threshold

Values in the range 30 to 200 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```50```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Lux auto report

Lux auto report

Values in the range 0 to 1440 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Reads back the lux level measured

Reads back the lux level measured

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The EH403-3 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
