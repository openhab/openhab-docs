## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AN370 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Binary Switch Report, Notification Report, Device Reset Locally Notification Indicator Report
The unit supports two association groups with 5 nodes support for Grouping 1 and 5 nodes support for Grouping 2. This has the effect that when the unit is operating, all devices associated with the unit will receive the relevant reports.

When the unit is powered for the first time, the unit will send a Notification Report to the node of Group 1.

When setting the unit or changing the unit’s status, the unit will send a Binary Switch Report to the node of Group 1.

When performing Reset the unit will send Device Reset Locally Notification to the node of Group1.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control: Basic Set

On/Off control
The unit supports two association groups with 5 nodes support for Grouping 1 and 5 nodes support for Grouping 2. This has the effect that when the unit is operating, all devices associated with the unit will receive the relevant reports.

When the button on the unit or the wall switch is pressed, the unit will send a Basic Set command to the nodes of Group 2. When the unit is OFF, Basic Set Value = 0x00. When the unit is ON, Basic Set Value = 0xFF.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
