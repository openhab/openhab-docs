# HAC01 In-Wall Remote Insert
This describes the Z-Wave device *HAC01*, manufactured by *Everspring* with the thing type UID of ```everspring_hac01_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The HAC01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

There are many application for the module ,

one application is connect the 2 wire of manual switch input to most of the wall switch sell in the market , while the connected wall switch been switched ON or OFF , the module will send the correspond signal to the associated devices like Z-Wave switch module HAN01 or any Z-Wave ON/OFF or dimmer modul

Another application is connect this module to any traditional wire sensor which has NC/NO manual switch input output, and this will easily convert those wire sensors into wireless Z-wave sensors. 

### Inclusion Information

Pressing link button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode. 

### Exclusion Information

Pressing link button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HAC01 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the HAC01.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set Level | The Basic Set Command is sent with this value. |
| 2 | Amount Of Delay | Amount Of Delay (seconds) to send the Basic Set Off command. |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set Level

The Basic Set Command is sent with this value.
The Basic Set Command is sent with value to have the receiving device recognize the value for controlled level, for example, if the Basic Set Command sent to dimmer with value, the dimmer would activate the luminance according to the value.  
  
0 : Off  
1 – 99 : On (for Binary Switch Device); Dim Level (for Multilevel Switch Device)
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Amount Of Delay

Amount Of Delay (seconds) to send the Basic Set Off command.
This is applied to determine the delay time setting to send the Basic Set Off command when the manual switch input at NO (open).  
  
Example :  
0 : immediately Off  
1 – 127 : delay 1 ~ 127 second to Off
Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HAC01 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Switch Input Change

Target nodes that receive Basic Set command when the switch input changed.
The remote module supports association with maximum 5 node for Grouping 1. Grouping 1 supports BASIC_SET.

When the manual switch input is from NC to NO or from NO to NC, HAC01 would send Basic Set Command to the nodes in Grouping 1 to On or Off the controlled device. Basic Set Command:

Manual switch input at NC: Command Class Basic, Basic Set, Value = 0xFF(255)

Manual switch input at NO: Command Class Basic, Basic Set, Value = 0x00(0)

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
