The HSM02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HSM02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Mini Door / Window Contact Detector

### Inclusion Information

Pressing tamper switch three times within 1.5 second will enter inclusion mode. 

### Exclusion Information

Pressing tamper switch three times within 1.5 second will enter exclusion mode. 

### Wakeup Information

The HSM02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


if set up is still needed, the user can press Tamper once more for HSM02 to be awake for another 30 sec.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HSM02 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door / Window Status | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door / Window Status
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the HSM02.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set Level | Value to be sent with a BASIC SET command |
| 2 | Configuring the OFF Delay | OFF Delay in seconds |
| 3 | Staying Awake (for testing) | Staying Awake (for testing) |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set Level

Value to be sent with a BASIC SET command
0: Off

1-99, 255: Dim Level (Multilevel Switch Device), ON (Binary Switch Device)
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Configuring the OFF Delay

OFF Delay in seconds
The Configuration parameter that can be used to adjust the amount of delay before the OFF command is transmitted. This parameter can be configured as 0-127, where 0 means sending OFF command immediately and 127 means 127 seconds of delay. 
Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Staying Awake (for testing)

Staying Awake (for testing)
Can be used to determine if the unit stays "awake" all the time. This parameter can be configured as 0 or 1, where 1 means "enabled" and 0 stands for "disabled"This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HSM02 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Target for reports

Support ALARM\_REPORT, SENSOR\_BINARY_SUPPORT
# Power Applied (Alarm Report)

Once the power has been applied, Alarm Report Command will be sent to Nodes in Grouping 1 to confirm the power applied status for HSM02. 

Power Applied Notice:**[Command Class Alarm, Alarm Report, Alarm Type = 0x02, Alarm Level = 0x01]**

# Magnet status report (Binary Sensor Report)

When the magnets of HSM02 are to be opened, Binary Sensor Report Command (Value = 0xFF) will be sent to Nodes in Grouping 1, and when the magnets are to be closed, Binary Sensor Report Command (Value = 0x00) will be sent as well.

Magnets to be opened: **[Command Class Sensor Binary, Sensor Binary Report, Value = 0xFF(255)]  
** Magnets to be closed: **[Command Class Sensor Binary, Sensor Binary Report, Value = 0x00(0)]**

# Low Battery Report (Alarm Report)

When HSM02 automatically wakes up, it will check the battery usage. When low battery is detected, Alarm Report Command will be sent to Nodes in Grouping 1, afterward, LED will light up for 1 sec to remind user when HSM02 is triggered due to open or close incidents.

Low Battery Report : **[Command Class Alarm, Alarm Report, Alarm Type = 0x01, Alarm Level = 0xFF]**

# Tamper Event Report (Alarm Report)

Press and hold the tamper switch more than 10 seconds then release, the unit will send ALARM REPORT command to the nodes of Grouping 1 to inform them there is a tamper event.

Tamper Event Report : **[Command Class Alarm, Alarm Report, Alarm Type = 0x01, Alarm Level = 0x11] **

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Target nodes who receive BASIC_SET command

# Control other Z-Wave Devices 

When door/window is opened, the unit will send BASIC_SET command which contains a value that is adjustable, to the nodes of Grouping 2. For instance, the brightness level of a lamp module can be fixed according to the set value. 

When the door/window is closed, the BASIC\_SET command will also be sent to the nodes of Grouping 2. For instance, a lamp module will be turned off after receiving the BASIC\_SET command

Basic Set Command:  
Event Present: **[Command Class Basic, Basic Set, Value = 99 (0x63)] **  
Event Clear: **[Command Class Basic, Basic Set, Value = 0 (0x00)] **

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
