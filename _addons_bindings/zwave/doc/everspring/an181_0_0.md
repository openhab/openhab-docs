The AN181 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Metering Plug is designed to control the on/off status appliances load in your house. For metering the unit can detect up to 10485.75kW*h and can support wattage, voltage, ampere, and PF detection. The unit can also detect overload upon which the unit will switch off relay and keep LED flashing until power is off and re-applied. At 220-240V voltage, this Plug can support up to 2500W resistive.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The AN181 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Target for automatic reports

Binary Switch Report, Notification Report, Device Reset Locally Notification, Meter Report
When powered on, the device will send (Notification Type = 0x08, Event = 0x01) to the node of Group 1. When overload occurs, the device will send (Notification Type = 0x08, Event = 0x08) to the node of Group 1.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Basic Set, Control:key1, On/Off control (Button1)

Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.
