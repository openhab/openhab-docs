The AN181 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The Metering Plug is designed to control the on/off status appliances load in your house. For metering the unit can detect up to 10485.75kW\*h and can support wattage, voltage, ampere, and PF detection. The unit can also detect overload upon which the unit will switch off relay and keep LED flashing until power is off and re-applied. At 220-240V voltage, this Plug can support up to 2500W resistive.

| 2 | Delaying time | Set the delaying time to report to Group 1 in seconds |
| 3 | Remember status | Set whether to remember the last status |
| 4 | Interval for wattage auto report | Set the interval for wattage auto report in minutes |
| 5 | Interval for kW*h auto report | Set the interval for kW\*h auto report in minutes |
| 6 | Auto report load surpasses value | Auto report when load surpasses the set value of wattage |
| 7 | Auto report change percentage | Auto report when the change of wattage surpasses the set percentage |

The AN181 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Target for automatic reports

Binary Switch Report, Notification Report, Device Reset Locally Notification, Meter Report
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

Basic Set, Control:key1, On/Off control (Button1)
This group supports 4 nodes.
