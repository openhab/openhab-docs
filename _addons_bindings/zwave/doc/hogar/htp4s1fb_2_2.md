The HTP-4S1-FB supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HTP-4S1-FB does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The HOGAR Touch Panels features a stunning glass face with advanced capacitive touch sensor engineered with smart home wireless standards Zigbee, Z-Wave Plus and Wifi variants.

The Smart Home deserves better than an ordinary light switch. Hogar touch panels are one-of-a-kind collection of switches, dimmers, and scene controller that will transform walls from boring to absolutely breath-taking.

Fits in existing electrical box and does not require new wires. Innovative assembly and snap-in system make it fast and simple to install.

### Wakeup Information

The HTP-4S1-FB does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
