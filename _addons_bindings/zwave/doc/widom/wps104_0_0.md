The WPS104 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

WiDom Energy Driven Switch is a device designed to monitor all **parameters**, **usage**, **faults** and **overloads** of your electrical system. Unlike an ordinary energy meter, WiDom Energy Driven Switch can be installed to monitor an entire electricity network or a section of the latter.

·         **Active Energy-saving management**

Automatically connects and disconnects a specific load if the established threshold limit is exceeded, or supplies the required power, momentarily excluding non-priority loads.

·         **Management and prevention of electrical faults** 

Identifies malfunctions based on irregular consumptions and to the maximum time of activity.

·         **Electrical overload management** 

Notifies or disconnects non-priority loads in the eventuality of system overloads.

### Inclusion Information

If the device is not included into a Z-Wave network, a single click on the (B) button or on the external switch will launch the process of traditional inclusion. If the device inclusion procedure does not start within 2 seconds, the Network Wide Inclusion network will be launched lasting a variable amount of time between 15-30 seconds

### Exclusion Information

Only a controller can remove a device from the network. WiDom Energy Driven Switch is compatible with all Z-Wave certified controllers. After the exclusion procedure has been activated by the controller, the device can be removed, putting it in _Exclusion_ _Mode_ by three consecutive clicks on the (B) button or on the external switch, when available.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WPS104 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Devices who will receive notification on: status changes; energy level and power;  local reset of the device

Received commands: Basic Report, Device Reset Locally Notification, Meter Report, Multilevel Sensor: Power Report

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Up Power Level Group

Devices controlled from Up Power Event

Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 3: Down Power Level Group

Devices controlled from Down Power Event

Association group 3 supports 8 nodes.
