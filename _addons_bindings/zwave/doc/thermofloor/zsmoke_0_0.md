The Z-Smoke Detector supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Heatit Z-Smoke Detector is a multi-functional smoke sensor with a built-in PIR motion sensor, temperature sensor and emergency light.

Heatit Z-Smoke Detector is a wireless operated photoelectronic smoke detector designed to interact with most Z-Wave enabled controllers.

The detector features smoke-, temperature-, and IR-detection.

### Inclusion Information

Set the primary controller / gateway in add / remove mode. 

After power is applied, the smoke detector initiates a 1-minute warm-up period. During this minute, the device will automatically enter add / remove mode, and may now be added to the system via the primary controller.

After the calibration process is finished, you may access the add / remove mode by pressing the function button three times within 1.5 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

Set the primary controller / gateway in add / remove mode and press the function button three times within 1.5 seconds.

Removing the device will reset it to factory settings. If the device already belongs to a network, you must remove it from that network before adding into a new one, or the setup will fail.  


When the device is removed from the network, it will revert to factory settings.

### General Usage Information

**LED-INDICATOR / FUNCTION BUTTON**

**Red LED**

  * Turns ON briefly: Transmitting signal.
  * Quick flash: Alarm.
  * Flashes every second: Smoke detector in sleep mode.
  * Flashes every 2 seconds: Smoke detector in warm-up and calibration process.
  * Flashes every 4 seconds: Battery exhausted.

**Orange LED**

  * Flashes every second: Device power-on/calibration failed.
  * Flashes every 5 seconds: Detecting smoke failed or device malfunctioning.
  * Flashes every 4 seconds: Battery exhausted.
  * Flashes every 45 seconds: Low battery condition

**Function button**

  * Press the button once to send a test signal and temperature report to gateway.
  * Press the button once during an alarm to silence the alarm.
  * Press the button 3 times within 1.5 seconds to learn mode.
  * Press and hold the button for 10 seconds to enter the calibration process.
  * Press and hold the button for 20 seconds to perform a factory reset.

**White LED (emergency light)**

  * The emergency light will begin to flash slowly to alert users that an alarm has been triggered.

**FACTORY RESET**

Press and hold the function button for 20 seconds. This will reset the smoke detector. It will also perform the calibration process.

NB! Please use this procedure only when the primary controller / gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Z-Smoke Detector -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Alarm (motion) | alarm_motion | alarm_motion | Motion | Switch | 
| Alarm (heat) | alarm_heat | alarm_heat | temperature_hot | Switch | 
| Alarm (smoke) | alarm_smoke | alarm_smoke | Smoke | Switch | 
| Alarm (tamper) | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Alarm (motion)
Indicates if a motion alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_motion``` channel is of type ```alarm_motion``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Motion``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (heat)
Indicates if a heat alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_heat``` channel is of type ```alarm_heat``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```temperature_hot``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (smoke)
Indicates if a smoke is triggered.

The ```alarm_smoke``` channel is of type ```alarm_smoke``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Smoke``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (tamper)
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Z-Smoke Detector supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline to controller
Lifeline group (reserved for communication with the main controller), 1 node allowed. Sends battery report, notification report, sensor multilevel report, device reset locally notification.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Smoke basic set

Smoke basic set
When the smoke detector is active, it will send basic set (0xFF). When the smoke detector is deactived, it will send basic set (0x00).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
