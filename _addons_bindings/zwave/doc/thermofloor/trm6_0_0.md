## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Heatit Z-TRM6 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline Group to be used by primary controller, sends

- Thermostat Mode Report

- Thermostat Setpoint Report

- Thermostat Operating State Report

- Protection Report

- Notification Report

- Meter Report

- Sensor Multilevel Report

- Device Reset Locally Notification

- Indicator Report

- Configuration Report

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Binary Switch Set

Binary Switch set commands based on the internal relay state

Sends:

- Binary Switch Set

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Thermostat Setpoint set

Thermostat Setpoint set commands based on own setpoint to allow for use as master thermostat

Sends:

-Thermostat Setpoint Set

Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Thermostat Mode set

Thermostat Mode set commands based on own mode to allow for use as master thermostat
