## Overview

The Heatit Z-Wave is an electronic thermostat for floor heating in a standard wall box. The thermostat has a built-in Z-Wave chip that can be connected with Home Automation systems.

Heatit Z-Wave is equipped with a single pole switch and fits into most System 55 frames (Elko RS16, Schneider Exxact, Gira, Jung etc.) The thermostat can withstand a load of max 16A / 3600W at 230V. At higher loads the thermostat must control a contactor. The thermostat may be connected to two wired external sensors.

The thermostat has the capacity of up to 8 associations (relays, wall plugs etc.)

The thermostat is designed for electrical heating.
