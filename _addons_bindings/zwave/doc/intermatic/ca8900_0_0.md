## Overview

ThermostatEasy energy saving buttons (NORM / SAVE)

  * Easy Mode Switching Buttons (HEAT/OFF/COOL)
  *  Can be used with all 24VAC heating and cooling systems. It cannot be used with line voltage systems.
  *  Is Digital and your desired heat or cool temperatures can easily be set on the large screen with the TEMP UP (+) and TEMP DOWN (-) buttons on the front.
  *  A minimum 4-minute off time protects heating and cooling systems from damage.
  *  Uses a new technique called sequential staging for more comfort with faster reaction to requested temperature changes.
  * Battery Backup with 2 x "AA" batteries (included)
