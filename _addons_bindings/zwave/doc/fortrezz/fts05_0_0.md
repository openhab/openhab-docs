The FTS05 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FTS05 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Gain peace of mind when away from home. Aging and faulty appliances, corroded water heaters, fixtures in bathrooms and laundry rooms can all cause water damage in the home, which is an expensive fix! Our flood sensor alerts you when it gets wet. Just simply place on the floor near water using appliances and fixtures such as dishwashers, toilets, and washing machines.

When paired with our automated water shut-off valve, it will signal the valve to automatically turn off the water supply, eliminating any further damage from occurring. Sensor also monitors temperature to detect freezing conditions and even high heat in case of a fire. Place the sensor directly on the floor or in a cabinet under or near water using appliances and fixtures.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Set inclusion mode on your controller
  2. Press and hold the program button for 1-3 seconds. The LED on the sensor will blink twice if successful. 

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set inclusion mode on your controller
  2. Press and hold the program button for 1-3 seconds. The LED on the sensor will blink twice if successful. 

### Wakeup Information

The FTS05 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Check to make sure the sensor isn’t already in a network. Press the program button and observe LED indicator. You

may need to first exclude the unit from a network, then include it.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the FTS05.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Temperature low threshold | Temperature low threshold |
| 2 | Temperature high threshold | Temperature high threshold |
| 4 | Water Alarm Association Mode | Water Alarm Association Mode (send Basic Set ON or Basic Set OFF when alarm detected) |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Temperature low threshold

Temperature low threshold

Values in the range -10 to 69 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```4```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature high threshold

Temperature high threshold

Values in the range -9 to 70 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```70```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Water Alarm Association Mode

Water Alarm Association Mode (send Basic Set ON or Basic Set OFF when alarm detected)

Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FTS05 supports 7 association groups.

### Group 2: Water Alarm Active

Basic Set Command ON (default, 0xFF) or OFF (0x00) for Water Alarm Activity
Basic Set Command ON (default, 0xFF) or OFF (0x00) is sent to the associated nodes to indicate that a Water Alarm is active. This depends on the parameter 4 configuration value. When the water alarm is cleared, one additional report with the opposite value is sent.

Association group 2 supports 2 nodes.

### Group 3: Temperature High Condition

Basic Set Command with value = 0xFF is sent to the associated nodes to indicate that a Temperature High condition has been detected.
Basic Set Command with value = 0xFF is sent to the associated nodes to indicate that a Temperature High condition has been detected. When the temperature is back in the normal range, one additional report with value = 0x00 is sent.

Association group 3 supports 2 nodes.

### Group 4: Temperature Low Condition

Basic Set Command with value = 0xFF is sent to the associated nodes to indicate that a Temperature Low condition has been detected.
Basic Set Command with value = 0xFF is sent to the associated nodes to indicate that a Temperature Low condition has been detected. When the temperature is back in the normal range, one additional report with value = 0x00 is sent.
