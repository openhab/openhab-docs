The MIMOlite supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The MIMOlite module provides one analog or digital input and one relay output (isolated dry contacts, NO-COM-NC) and can be controlled by ZWaveTM. The system includes a program switch for Z-WaveTM inclusion/exclusion and a status light (LED) for various indications.

Input SIG1 is an analog input, internally pulled-up to the MIMOlite supply voltage. The system allows trigger conditions to be set based on the input voltage being inside or outside a user-defined range (configured via Z-Wave). This provides great flexibility for capturing events in a wide variety of applications. The trigger status of the input can be read via Z-WaveTM and/or can be automatically sent to a configured node, typically the Controller. In addition, a count of the trigger events that have occurred for the input channel is internally recorded (and stored in the ‘pulse count’) and is available to be requested or automatically sent via Z-Wave. The current triggered/un-triggered status can also be read via ZWave. The SIG1 input can be associated with up to two other Z-WaveTM devices, such that an associated device will automatically turn on (or off) based on the occurrence of a trigger event. Finally, the analog input channel can be configured so that the analog input level (not just binary trigger status) is periodically sent to up to two other associated nodes.

The output relay is typically commanded via Z-WaveTM commands. In addition, the user can configure the input SIG1 trigger condition to be mapped to the output relay. For example, Relay 1 can be automatically turned on based on Input SIG1 being triggered. The relay activation can be set via a jumper or via Z-WaveTM for either momentary or latched operation.

### Inclusion Information

1. Set up the inclusion mode at the controller (for detailed directions, please refer to your controller user manual)
2. If the LED has a periodic single blink, the unit will be automatically included. Otherwise, the button has been previously pressed and automatic inclusion mode is no longer active. In this case, briefly press the button once and the controller will indicate that the unit has been included in the network. Also, the Status LED will blink when the inclusion completes. Inclusion and exclusion are always done at normal transmit power mode.

### Exclusion Information

1. Set up the exclusion mode at the controller (for detailed directions, please refer to your controller user manual)
2. Press the MIMOlite button and the controller will indicate the unit has been removed from the network. The Status LED will blink when the exclusion completes.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 10 configuration parameters available in the MIMOlite.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Clear_Pulse_Meter_Counts |  |
| 3 | Trigger_Mapping | Input-to-relay Mapping |
| 4 | Lower_Threshold_High | Lower Threshold, High |
| 5 | Lower_Threshold_Low | Lower Threshold, Low |
| 6 | Upper_Threshold_High | Upper Threshold, High |
| 7 | Upper_Threshold_Low | Upper Threshold, Low |
| 8 | Trigger_Level_And_Input_Threshold |  |
| 9 | Multilevel_AutoReport_Interval | Multilevel AutoReport Interval |
| 10 | Not_Used_2 |  |
| 11 | Momentary_Relay1_Duration | Momentary Relay1 output enable/disable (100msec). |

### Parameter 2: Clear_Pulse_Meter_Counts



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Clear Pulse Meter Counts |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Clear Pulse Meter Counts).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Trigger_Mapping

Input-to-relay Mapping
The MIMOlite can be configured to automatically turn the relay on when the input is triggered or a Z-Wave command can also turn the relay on. The Configuration Command Class, Parameter 3, is used to set the input-to-relay mapping (See Technical Appendix). When input-to-relay mapping is enabled, Z-WaveTM commands to set the relay are overridden. The default for the relay is no input-to-relay mapping. Momentary vs Latched relay operation is selected by jumper P5 on the circuit board. The Momentary/Latched jumper is read only at power on when the MIMOlite is not in a ZWave network. When the jumper is off, momentary (default 500ms) operation is selected. If desired, once in-network, a Zwave configuration command (Parameter 11) can be used to override the jumper setting. The momentary configuration can be set from 100ms to 25.5ms (approximate) in increments of 100ms via the ZWave command.

Note that neither a Basic Report nor a Binary Switch Report is sent when relay is automatically set or cleared by Trigger Mapping.
The following option values may be configured -:
