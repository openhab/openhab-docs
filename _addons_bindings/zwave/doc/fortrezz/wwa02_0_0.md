# WWA-01 / WWA-02 Wireless Water and Temperature Alarm
This describes the Z-Wave device *WWA-01 / WWA-02*, manufactured by *FortrezZ LLC* with the thing type UID of ```fortrezz_wwa02_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The WWA-01 / WWA-02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The WWA-01 / WWA-02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

 This product will provide you with the peace of mind and protection you expect. Leaking pipes, corroded water heaters, fixtures in bathrooms and laundry rooms, refrigerator drip pans, etc. can all cause water damage. The WWA-01AA is a Z-WaveTM enabled device and will send a water leak alert on any Z-WaveTM enabled network. A WWA-01AA unit that is not in a Z-WaveTM network will still alert you to water leaks using the audio alarm. The WWA-01AA must not be used in life support and/or safety applications. Information provided in this manual is for your convenience and may be superseded by updates. The specifications and this manual are subject to change without notice. It is your responsibility to ensure that the WWA-01AA meets your specifications.

### Inclusion Information

1) Set up the inclusion mode at the controller; 2) Press the button (or hold the button for approx. 2 seconds) until the controller indicates the unit has been included in the network. Also, a beep will be heard when the inclusion completes. Inclusion and exclusion are always done at normal transmit power mode. 

### Exclusion Information

1) Set up the exclusion mode at the controller; 2) Press the button for approx. 2 seconds until the controller indicates the unit has been removed from the network. A beep will also be heard when the exclusion completes.

### Wakeup Information

The WWA-01 / WWA-02 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


 To remain awake and listen for commands (when in a network), press and hold the button for at least 2 seconds. The WWA-01AA will stay awake for approx. 30 seconds. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the WWA-01 / WWA-02 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Alarm | alarm_flood | alarm_flood | Water | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Alarm
Indicates if the flood alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_flood``` channel is of type ```alarm_flood``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Water``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the WWA-01 / WWA-02.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Low Temperature Trigger Point |  |
| 2 | High Temperature Trigger Point |  |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Low Temperature Trigger Point



Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```4```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: High Temperature Trigger Point



Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```70```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WWA-01 / WWA-02 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Water and Temperature Alarms


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Water Alarms


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Temperature Alarms


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
