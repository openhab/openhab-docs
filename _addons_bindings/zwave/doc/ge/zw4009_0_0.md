The ZW4009 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

In-Wall Smart Toggle Switch (120/277VAC) with QuickFit and SimpleWire enhancements. Revolutionary QuickFit design features a housing depth that is up to 20 percent smaller than the previous Z-Wave models. This reduced size coupled with the elimination of heat taps provides a better fit in older style boxes and multi-gang configurations. SimpleWire technology allows line and load to automatically be configured with auto-sensing line-load terminals. All of this is coupled with Z-Wave S2 and Smart Start allows for effortless installation while being safer than ever!

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW4009 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Press ON/OFF

Supports Basic Set and is controlled by pressing the ON or OFF button with the local load.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Double press ON/OFF
