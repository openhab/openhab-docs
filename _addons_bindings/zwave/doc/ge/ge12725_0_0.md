## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the GE 12725 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 9 configuration parameters available in the GE 12725.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Night Light | Defines the behavior of the blue LED.   
 Default is Night Light mode where LED is on when switch is off. |
| 4 | Invert Switch | Invert the ON/OFF Switch State.   
 Setting this parameter to Yes will change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom to ON.   
 Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, the load will now be control |
| 5 | Ignore Start-Level (Receiving) | This dimmer will start dimming from its current level. |
