The Jasco 14318 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Transform any home into a smart home with the Jasco Z-Wave In-Wall Smart Switch. The on/off switch replaces your current light switch, uses your existing wiring, and provides Z-Wave wireless and in-wall control of overhead lighting. The switch enables wireless control of on/off functions of direct wire incandescent, LED, xenon, halogen and fluorescent lighting. Providing ultimate flexibility, the Jasco Z-Wave Smart Lighting Control On/Off Switch allows you to operate the switch by itself or easily integrate the switch with two-way, three-way or four-way wiring configurations by adding the Jasco Add-On switch. Single pole wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from one location. Three-way wiring configuration turns the light on/off from two separate locations. Four-way wiring configuration turns the light on/off from three separate locations. The Jasco Add-On Switch is required for Three-way or Four-way installations. The lighting control includes a blue LED indicator light to easily locate the switch in a dark room. Take control of your home lighting with Jasco Z-Wave Smart Lighting Controls!

### Inclusion Information

Once the controller is ready to include your device, press and release the top or bottom of the wireless smart switch(rocker) to include it in the network.

### Exclusion Information

Once the controller is ready to exclude your device, press and release the top button of the wireless smart switch (rocker) to exclude it from the network.

### Wakeup Information

The Jasco 14318 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Jasco 14318 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: ontrolled with the local load.

Supports Basic Set
Supports Basic Set and is controlled with the local load.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: ontrolled by double pressing the On or Off button.
