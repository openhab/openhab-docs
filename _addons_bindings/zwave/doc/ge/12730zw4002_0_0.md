### Inclusion Information

  1. Follow the instructions for your Z-wave certified controller to include a device to the Z-wave network.
  2. Once the controller is ready to include your device, press and release the top or bottom of the smart fan control switch (rocker) to include it in the network. Note: Your controller may need to be within 10 feet of the device to be included.
  3. Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been included, refresh the Z-wave network to optimize performance.

Please reference the controller/gateway’s manual for instructions. Now you have complete control to turn your fixture ON/OFF and adjust fan speed levels according to groups, scenes, schedules and interactive automation programmed by your controller. If your Z-wave certified controller features Remote Access, you can now control your fixture from your mobile devices.

Note: To exclude and reset the device, follow the instructions provided by your Z-Wave controller

### Exclusion Information

  1. Follow the instructions for your Z-wave certified controller to exclude a device to the Z-wave network.
  2. Once the controller is ready to exclude your device, press and release the top or bottom of the smart fan control switch (rocker) to exclude it in the network. Note: Your controller may need to be within 10 feet of the device to be exclude.
  3. Once your controller has confirmed that the device has been excluded, refresh the Z-wave network to optimize performance.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED on when light off |
| 1 | LED on when light on |
| 2 | LED always off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LED on when light off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Invert Switch
Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON, if the switch was installed upside down.

| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Z-Wave Command Dim Step

Z-Wave Command Dim Step
Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.
