## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GE 28169 / Jasco 28168 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Supports Lifeline, Binary Switch Report

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Single Press Button

Sends message directly to configured node on single press of button.
This device will send a Basic Set Message directly to whatever Z-wave device you have mapped this setting to when you single press the on/off button. For example, if you map this setting to a wall switch and then single press the on/off button on this "Plug in Smart Switch," a corresponding on/off message will be sent directly to that wall switch, bypassing openHAB.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Double Press button

Sends message directly to configured node on double press of button.
This device will send a Basic Set Message directly to whatever Z-wave device you have mapped this setting to when you double press the on/off button. For example, if you map this setting to a wall switch and then double press the on/off button on this "Plug in Smart Switch," a corresponding on/off message will be sent directly to that wall switch, bypassing openHAB.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
