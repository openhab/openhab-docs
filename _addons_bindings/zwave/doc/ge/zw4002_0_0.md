The ZW4002 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

**Basic Operation**

Note: Before starting, fan must be set to ‘HIGH’ position using pull chain. The connected fan can then be turned ON/OFF and adjust speed levels in two ways:

  1. Manually from the front panel rocker of the In-wall Fan Control
  2. Remotely with a Z-Wave controller

**Manual Control**

To turn the connected fan ON: Press and release the top of the rocker. Note: Fan will return to last speed setting of Fan Control. Default setting – HIGH.

To turn the fan OFF: Press and release the bottom of the rocker.

**Adjust fan speed**

To decrease fan speed: Press and hold lower rocker.

To increase fan speed: Press and hold upper rocker.

The LED indicator confirms fan speed settings by flashing patterns

  * LOW – LED will blink every 2 seconds for 10 seconds
  * MEDIUM – LED will blink every second for 10 seconds
  * HIGH – LED will blink every half second for 10 seconds

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW4002 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Controlled with local load

Supports Basic Set and is controlled with the local load

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Double Tap

Supports Basic Set and is controlled by double pressing the On or Off button

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
