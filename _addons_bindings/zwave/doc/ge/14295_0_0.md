## Overview

Transform any home into a smart home with the GE Z-Wave In-Wall Smart Toggle Dimmer. The dimmer enables wireless control of on/off and dim functions of hard-wired dimmable LED/CFL and incandescent lighting. The dimmer replaces your current light switch, uses your existing wiring, and provides Z-Wave wireless and in-wall control of overhead lighting. Use the dimmer feature to customize the lighting output and create the perfect ambiance for any room. Providing ultimate flexibility, the In-Wall Smart Dimmer allows you to operate the switch by itself or easily integrate the switch three-way or four-way wiring configurations by adding the GE Add-On Switch. Single Pole wiring configuration controls the light from one location. Three-way wiring configuration controls the light from two separate locations. Four-way wiring configuration controls the light from three separate locations. The GE Add-On Switch is required for three-way or four-way installations. Take control of your home lighting with GE Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Controls!
