## Overview

#### Description

Set your life in motion with the Z-Wave Plus In-Wall Smart Motion Switch. This energy-efficient sensor works with your home’s gateway to wirelessly trigger scenes and send alerts to your smartphone or tablet whenever motion is has turned lights on or off.

Three different modes offer the best lighting option for you: occupancy, vacancy and manual. In occupancy mode, the lights will automatically turn on when you enter the room and automatically turn off once you’ve left (customizable between 5 seconds and 30 minutes).

In vacancy mode, the lights are turned on manually and will turn off automatically after a preset amount of time. In manual mode, the lights will function as a normal light switch and manually turn on and off. Along with conveniently saving you time and energy costs, the smart motion dimmer can replace any existing light switch in your home, and can be used in 3- and 4-way applications.

You may also coordinate the switch with your household decor with the included white and light almond buttons. Experience the comfort of automation in your life when you come home to the Z-Wave Plus In Wall Smart Motion Switch.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The In-Wall Smart Motion Dimmer supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline, Multi-Level Report

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 1

Supports Basic Set and is controlled by pressing On/Off button

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 2

Supports Basic Set and is controlled by pressing On/Off button

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
