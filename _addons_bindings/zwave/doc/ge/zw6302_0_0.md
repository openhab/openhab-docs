The ZW6302 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZW6302 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The ZW6302 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZW6302 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the ZW6302.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 13 | Motion Sensor | Motion Sensor |
| 18 | PIR Timeout Duration | PIR Timeout Duration |
| 20 | Basic Set, Notification and Basic Report | Basic Set, Notification and Basic Report |
| 28 | Enable & Disable the LED indication when PIR is triggered | Enable & Disable the LED indication when PIR is triggered |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 13: Motion Sensor

Motion Sensor
Detect Motion
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Low Sensitivity |
| 2 | Medium Sensitivity |
| 3 | High Sensitivity |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3``` (High Sensitivity).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 18: PIR Timeout Duration

PIR Timeout Duration

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 1 min to 60 min |
| 255 | 5 seconds |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```60```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_18_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 20: Basic Set, Notification and Basic Report

Basic Set, Notification and Basic Report

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Motion Sensor will send out Notification |
| 2 | Motion Sensor will send out Basic Set |
| 3 | Motion Sensor will sendout Basic Report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Motion Sensor will send out Notification).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_20_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 28: Enable & Disable the LED indication when PIR is triggered

Enable & Disable the LED indication when PIR is triggered

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_28_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW6302 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: ZW6302

Portable Smart Motion Sensor
This group supports 5 nodes.
