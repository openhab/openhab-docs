## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 9 configuration parameters available in the 45606.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Night Light | Defines the behavior of the blue LED. |
| 4 | Invert Switch | Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON. |
| 5 | Ignore Start-Level (Receiving) | This dimmer will start dimming from its current level. |
| 7 | On/Off Command Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 8 | On/Off Command Dim Rate | Sets the rate at which the dimmer changes the light level. |
| 9 | Local Control Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 10 | Local Control Dim Rate | Sets the dim rate |
| 11 | ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Step | Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step. |
| 12 | ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate | Sets the dim rate for the all on/off command |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 3: Night Light

Defines the behavior of the blue LED.
Default is Night Light mode where LED is on when switch is off.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED on when switch is OFF |
| 1 | LED on when switch is ON |
| 2 | LED always off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LED on when switch is OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON.
Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Ignore Start-Level (Receiving)

This dimmer will start dimming from its current level.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: On/Off Command Dim Step
