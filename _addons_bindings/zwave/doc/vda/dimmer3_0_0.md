The Vitrum III EU Dimmer supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

When the device is in the stand-alone mode and is not included in a Z-Wave network the illuminated ring around the touch keys will light red for a moment when passing from one mode to another.

### Inclusion Information

With the controller in the inclusion mode, press any of the touch keys on the device.

### Exclusion Information

Press and hold the leftmost touch key for at least 8 seconds. The device will flash red three times and sound an acoustic signal to indicate that the original factory setting has been restored.
