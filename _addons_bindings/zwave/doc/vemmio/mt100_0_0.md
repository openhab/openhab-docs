The MT-100 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The MT-100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Motion Mini Sensor provides accurate motion and illumination level detection. When integrated with your controller - wireless notifications, low battery alerts, custom automation scenarios based on both light and motion triggers become available. For example, when motion is detected, the controller will send an alert to any smartphone, set off an alarm or trigger a lighting scene. The sensor works with any Z-Wave-certified controller 

Wireless standard Z-Wave Plus Frequency 868.40 MHz Network range 30 m line of sight Operating temperature 0°C ~ 40°C Illumination measurement range 0 ~ 8500 lux Movement Sensor Measurement range 6 m Battery CR123A 3V Battery >2 years, low power indication.

Factory reset: press and hold the Z-Wave button for at least 10 seconds until the LED indicator flashes once (it may then flash 5 times to indicate the device is no longer part of Z-Wave network). Release the button.

### Inclusion Information

When prompted by the controller, press quickly one of the Z-wave button 3 times in a row. The sensor should be included in 5 seconds. The sensor should appear on your controller’s device list.

### Exclusion Information

When prompted by the controller, press quickly one of the Z-wave button 3 times in a row. The sensor should be excluded in 5 seconds. The sensor should appear on your controller’s device list.

### Wakeup Information

The MT-100 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


You can press the button once to wake up the device and send wakeup notification to controller -the LED will flash once.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the MT-100 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (luminance) | sensor_luminance | sensor_luminance |  | Number | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

This Parameter can be set the light sensor measure ambient illumination level

interval time. NOTE: This Value Must Be less than Wakeup Interval Time
Values in the range 60 to 36000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: Lux Level Function Enable

Lux Level Function Enable
If this parameter is set to ‘1’, and when Lux level less than the value define by parameter #5, PIR detector will send a BASIC\_SET command frame (i.e. BASIC\_SET (value = parameter 3) to an associated device and activate it. If Lux Level greater than the value define by parameter #5, PIR detector will not send a BASIC_SET command frame.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Led Flash Enable

This parameter defines the Led on/off enable
This parameter defines the Led on/off enable. If this parameter is set to ‘1’, the led blink will be enabled, the led will flash once when motion sensor detect a movement. Otherwise, the led will be turned off always.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MT-100 supports 4 association groups.
