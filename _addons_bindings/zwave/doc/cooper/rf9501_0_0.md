The RF9501 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The RF9501 is a battery operated device that allows you to install a switch/dimmer almost anywhere you desire and control (On/Off/Dim/Brighten) loads/lights wired to ASPIRE RF devices using the Associations.

### Inclusion Information

Press the switch one time to include it in the network.

### Exclusion Information

Press the switch one time to exclude it from the network.

| 2 | Panic ON time | The time in seconds the switch will turn on for when panic mode is triggered |
| 3 | Panic OFF time | The time in seconds the switch will turn off for when panic mode is triggered |
| 4 | Basic Set Value | Value to be transmitted to devices in association group |
| 5 | Power Up State | Power Up State of the switch |
| 6 | Panic mode enable | Enables this switch to participate in panic mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Delayed OFF time

The time in seconds the switch will delay when trigger the delayed off feature

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Panic ON time

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Basic Set Value

Value to be transmitted to devices in association group
Setting this to anything other than 0 will cause the value to be transmitted to devices in the association group when the switch is triggered. A setting other than 0 will likely result in undesired operation
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

| 2 | On |
| 3 | Last State |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Panic mode enable

Enables this switch to participate in panic mode

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Off |
| 2 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9501 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
