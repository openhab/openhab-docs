## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the RF9542.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Delayed OFF time | delay time in seconds |
| 2 | Panic ON time | time in seconds for panic mode |
| 3 | Panic OFF time | off time in seconds for panic mode |
| 4 | Basic Set Value | send this value to associated devices |
| 5 | Power Up State | Power Up State of the switch |
| 6 | Panic mode enable | Enables this switch to participate in panic mode |
| 7 | Dimmer Ramp Time | time in seconds to ramp to desired level |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Delayed OFF time

delay time in seconds
The amount of time in seconds the switch will delay when trigger the delayed off feature
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Panic ON time

time in seconds for panic mode
The amount of time in seconds the switch will turn on for when panic mode is triggered
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Basic Set Value

send this value to associated devices
Setting this to anything other than 0 will cause the value to be transmitted to devices in the association group when the switch is triggered. A setting other than 0 will likely result in undesired operation
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Power Up State

| 2 | ON |
| 3 | Last State |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Panic mode enable

Enables this switch to participate in panic mode

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | OFF |
| 2 | ON |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Dimmer Ramp Time

time in seconds to ramp to desired level
The amount of time in seconds the switch will take to reach the desired dim level
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9542 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.
