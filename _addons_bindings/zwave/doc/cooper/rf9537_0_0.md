| 2 | Panic ON time | Time in seconds for panic mode ON |
| 3 | Panic OFF time | time in seconds for OFF in panic mode |
| 4 | Basic Set Value | Send value to association group on trigger |
| 5 | Power Up State | Power Up State of the switch |
| 6 | Panic mode enable | Enables this switch to participate in panic mode |
| 7 | Dimmer Ramp Time | Time in seconds to reach desired level |
| 8 | Kickstart / Rapid Start | Turn on or off rapid start feature |
| 11 | Minimum Dimmer Level | The minimum dim level the switch will allow |
| 12 | Maximum Dimmer Level | The maximum dim level the switch will allow |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Delayed OFF time

time in seconds to delay OFF
The amount of time in seconds the switch will delay when trigger the delayed off feature
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Panic ON time

Time in seconds for panic mode ON
The amount of time in seconds the switch will turn on for when panic mode is triggered

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The RF9537 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 255: Group 255

Life line to the controller

Association group 255 supports 1 node.
