The WD500Z-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

500W, 120 VAC Wall Mounted Dimmer

### Inclusion Information

Pushing the top or bottom of the switch, the WD500Z-1 allows the user to include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

Pushing the top or bottom of the switch, the WD500Z-1 allows the user to include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave network.

### General Usage Information

The default Command Poll Period of 1500ms can cause issues with state updating properly after a remote command is received due to the transition period between states of around 2.5s. This manifests as a switch turned fully off in real life, but showing as 50% on in the OpenHAB UI.

Recommended to update this setting to > 2500ms to provide more consistent results.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the WD500Z-1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WD500Z-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Controller


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Double Tap


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Triple Tap


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
