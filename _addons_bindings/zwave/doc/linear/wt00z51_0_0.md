## Overview

**3-WAY WALL MOUNT ACCESSORY DIMMER SWITCH**

The GoControl™ family of Z-Wave® certified wireless Lighting Products (smart LED fixtures, bulbs, switches, dimmers, outlets and plug-in modules) Control Products (thermostats, irrigation controller and garage door controller) and Sensors (flood, leak, alert sounder, motion sensor and door/window sensor) bring a new level of intelligent wireless Home Automation capability to commercial and residential environments.

The Z-Wave wireless protocol is an international wireless standard for remote home automation, security and other applications. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

The WT00Z5-1 Wall Mount Accessory Dimmer Switch allows remote ON/OFF control and dimming of lights controlled by associated Z-Wave modules, creating virtual 3-way switches. The WT00Z5-1 controls no load directly, so it can be wired anywhere power is available, without the need for a traveler wire. GoControl Z-Wave products are easy to install, are Z-Wave certified, and allow dealers to create an integrated wireless network with nearly limitless expansion and interoperability with security, energy management, home entertainment, appliances, and more.

**DANGER! SHOCK HAZARD.** Read and understand these instructions before installing. This device is intended for installation in accordance with the National Electric code and local regulations in the United States, or the Canadian Electrical Code and local regulations in Canada. It is recommended that a qualified electrician perform this installation. For indoor use only. Retain instructions for future use.

**Z-WAVE PLUS FEATURES**

The WT00Z5-1 contains a Z-Wave 500 Series Module that supports Z-Wave Plus® features. A Z-Wave certified portable or stationary Controller can communicate with the Z-Wave 500 Series Module.

Depending on the capability of the Controller or gateway software, the following operations can be performed with the WT00Z5-1. Refer to the Controller or gateway manual for details.

  * Turn the Associated device ON and OFF.
  * Dim the Associated device.
  * Add or Remove the WT00Z5-1.
  * Over-the-air firmware update by the gateway or static Controller.
  * Assign the WT00Z5-1 to a specific Group/Scene and/or to include the Associated device as part of ALL ON or ALL OFF system commands.
  * Lifeline function which automatically notifies the Associated modules and the network that a manually reset device is no longer in the network, thus, the corresponding Association becomes invalid.

### Inclusion Information

Refer to your Controller operating instructions to add this switch under the command of the Wireless Controller.

  1. With your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the switch. The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.
  2. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was added” to the network and the LED will stop blinking.
  3. The device will appear in the list of Switches. It should display as a switch.

If the Controller/Gateway shows the addition failed, repeat Steps 1-3.

✓ **NOTE**: If you have trouble adding the WT00Z5-1 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT” to remove it from the network. Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions as a repeater (only). “RESET UNIT” removes it completely from the network.

**To Reset Unit (If Required):** In the event that your primary Controller is lost or otherwise inoperable, to reset the WT00Z5-1 and clear all network information, follow these steps:

  1. Tap the top of the switch five (5) times.
  2. Press and hold the bottom of the switch for 15 seconds. The LED will increasingly blink faster to indicate that a Reset is taking place.

### Exclusion Information

The WT00Z5-1 can be removed from the network by the Controller/Gateway. Refer to the Controller operating instructions for details.

  1. Set the Controller into Removal Mode and follow its instruction to delete the WT00Z5-1 from the Controller.
  2. Remove the switch by tapping the paddle 2 times. The LED will begin blinking slowly for 10 seconds indicating that it has been removed.
  3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was removed” from the network.

### General Usage Information

  * Press and Hold the bottom of switch to decrease the intensity of the Associated device.
  * Tapping top of switch turns the Associated device ON to the previously set level.
  * Tapping bottom of switch turns the Associated device OFF.

**LED Indication**

To act as a night light, the LED on the WT00Z5-1 will turn ON when the Associated device is OFF. However, the LED can be user configured to turn ON, when the Associated device is ON, if so desired. See “CONFIGURATION” section.

**Remote Control**

The WT00Z5-1 will respond to BASIC and BINARY commands that are part of the Z-Wave system. Refer to your Controller’s instructions as to whether your Controller can transmit those commands.

**Creating Associations**

  1. Learn all devices into the Z-Wave Hub.
  2. Tap the paddle of the WT00Z5-1 four times quickly to enter Association mode. The LED will begin to blink quickly (twice per second).
  3. Follow the instructions for inclusion or exclusion of the device to be associated. For GoControl devices, tap the button two times.
  4. Repeat Step #2 and #3 for up to 5 total dimmers and / or switches within 60 seconds of entering Association mode.
  5. Association mode will turn off after 60 seconds or when a node has been associated.

Although the Associations are now functional, it is recommended that you refer to your Hubs instructions to “Heal” the Z-Wave network to recognize the new Associations. Dimmers are automatically assigned to group 3 and other devices are assigned to group 2.

**Removing Associations**

To remove the Associations, if the Hub has recognized the Associations, refer to the Z-Wave Hub’s instructions on how to remove Associations. If the Hub has not recognized the Associations, removing the WT00Z5-1 from the Z-Wave network will eliminate the Associations

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WT00Z5-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1 is the “Lifeline” group and must be assigned the Node ID of the Z-Wave Controller to which unsolicited notifications from the WT00Z5-1 will be sent. Group 1 supports a single Node ID. The Z-Wave Controller should set the Lifeline Association automatically after inclusion. For instructions on how to set Associations, please refer to your Z-Wave Controller instructions. 

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Switches

For control of on/off type switches
Group 2 nodes will be sent BASIC On/Off commands and is intended to control switches like the GoControl WS15Z5.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmable Switches

For control of dimmable type switches
 Group 3 nodes will be sent Multilevel Switch commands and is intended to control dimmers like the GoControl WD500Z5.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
