# WA00Z-1 Wall Mounted Switch
This describes the Z-Wave device *WA00Z-1*, manufactured by *Linear Corp* with the thing type UID of ```linear_wa00z1_00_000```.

The WA00Z-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The WA00Z-1 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/610) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the WA00Z-1 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the WA00Z-1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Activation of Central Scene | Set top and bottom button scene numbers. |
| 2 | Control Mode | Control other devices or issue various scene activation... |
| 4 | Invert Switch | Invert top of switch ON/OFF buttons |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Activation of Central Scene

Set top and bottom button scene numbers.
Z-Wave Plus introduces a new process for scene activation – “Central Scene   
Control”. Press and release the button, it will send a certain command to the   
central controller via the lifeline association group 1. This allows the controller   
to react to both a button press and a button release. This mode implements   
communication pattern 6, and requires a gateway supporting Z-Wave Plus.
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Control Mode

Control other devices or issue various scene activation...
... commands to a central controller.
Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Invert top of switch ON/OFF buttons
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON, set Parameter 4 to a value of 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WA00Z-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3


This group supports 5 nodes.
