## Overview

The WD500Z5-1 is an in-wall lighting dimmer switch designed to operate with LED, halogen and incandescent lights. Not only can this switch control the connected load, with Central Scene support it can run up to 6 scenes created by the Hub it is the most versatile Home Automation light switch available. With OTA upgrading supported, this light switch may be the last one ever installed in a home.

### Inclusion Information

**Adding to a Network:** 

Refer to your Controller operating instructions to add this switch under the command of the Wireless Controller.

  1. With your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the switch. The LED will blink slowly when in ADD Mode.
  2. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was added” to the network and the LED will stop blinking.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The WD500Z5-1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic ON/OFF

Basic ON/OFF commands

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel Switch

Multilevel Switch commands

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
