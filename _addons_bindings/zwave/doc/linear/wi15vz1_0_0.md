# GoControl Smart Irrigation Controller Sprinkler Controller Supporting Flow Sensors, Rain Sensors and Moisture Sensors
This describes the Z-Wave device *GoControl Smart Irrigation Controller*, manufactured by *Linear Corp* with the thing type UID of ```linear_wi15vz1_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Valve*, defining Valves used to control water or gas. e.g. a flow stop valve..

The GoControl Smart Irrigation Controller supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The WI15Z5-1 Smart Irrigation Controller supports up to 15 valves using the Irrigation Command Class. A Z-Wave hub can use local weather conditions and connected rain and moisture sensors to optimizes the use of the scheduled watering cycles. As a connected device, sprinklers can be turned on or off from anywhere there is internet connectivity.   
Integrated diagnostics and flow sensor support help determine breaks or improper operation of the irrigation system. 

### Inclusion Information

Adding to a Network

NOTE: If you have trouble adding the GoControl Irrigation Controller to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must fi rst “RESET UNIT” to remove it from the network.

When the WI15VZ-1 is first powered up, the Status LED should be Red. If the Status LED is Green, the WI15VZ-1 needs to be reset (see below). To add it to your network refer to your controller operating instructions.

  1. With your controller in Discovery or Add Mode, tap the button (See Figure8).
  2. You should see an indication on your controller that the “device was added” to the network and the Green LED will blink. The device will appear in the list of switches. It should display as a switch. If the controller shows the addition failed, repeat Steps 1-3.

### Exclusion Information

Removing from a Network:

The GoControl Irrigation Controller can be removed from the network by the controller. Refer to the controller operating instructions for details.

  1. Set the controller into Removal Mode and follow its instructions to delete it from the controller.
  2. Remove the Irrigation Controller by tapping the button 2 times.
  3. You should see an indication on your controller that the “device was removed” from the network and the Green LED will blink then turn Red.

### General Usage Information

The WI15VZ-1 is designed to run the irrigation system based on your preprogrammed schedule. Utilizing your Z-Wave Hub, you can create this schedule. It will be saved in the WI15VZ-1 and run automatically unless an Interrupt is sent or received.

Each valve can run independently and be triggered as part of a scene. See the Hub instructions on how to confi gure your system to operate in this manner.

To trigger a specifi c valve that is connected to the WI15VZ-1, use the control application associated to your Z-Wave Hub.

Weather/Optional Water Sensor Interrupt

The WI15VZ-1 can take instructions from your Hub to not run the predetermined irrigation schedule. In the event that your local weather causes the WI15VZ-1 to not run the predetermined irrigation schedule, the LED will blink red/green for as long as the valves are supposed to be running. Once the valves are scheduled to be turned off, it will stop blinking.

All Stop

In the event that you wish to stop the running of the Irrigation Controller, press the button on the front of the WI15VZ-1. The Active LED will turn off. The Status LED will blink Orange. It will continue to blink Orange until the user presses the button again, or the Hub tells it to go back to normal mode.

Valve Fault Detection

The WI15VZ-1 can detect if a valve is disconnected or has damaged or shorted control wires. In the event that a Fault is detected, the Status LED will blink Red as long as the valve is scheduled to be running. Once the valve is scheduled to be off, or turned off by the Hub, it will stop blinking Red.

Power Fault Detection

The WI15VZ-1 can determine if there is a problem with the power provided by the power supply. In the event that a Fault is detected, the Status LED will toggle Red/Orange until the problem is corrected. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the GoControl Smart Irrigation Controller -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | time_offset | Time | Number | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Clock Time Offset
Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel is of type ```time_offset``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Time``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the GoControl Smart Irrigation Controller.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Master Valve Delay | Delay in seconds |
| 12 | Flow Sensor K value | Unique to flow sensor |
| 13 | Flow Sensor Offset value | Unique to the flow sensor |

### Parameter 2: Master Valve Delay

Delay in seconds

Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 12: Flow Sensor K value

Unique to flow sensor

Values in the range 0 to 2147483647 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Flow Sensor Offset value

Unique to the flow sensor

Values in the range 0 to 2147483647 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GoControl Smart Irrigation Controller supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
