The GB00Z supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The GB00Z does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The GB00Z is a Glass break sensor/transmitter with built-in Z-Wave® technology.

  * The sensor mounts on a wall or ceiling within 15 feet of the protected glass window(s).
  * The detector is powered from two 3-Volt CR123A lithium batteries (included).
  * Three screws and screw anchors are provided for mounting the detector.

### Inclusion Information

Before adding the device to any Z-Wave network, or after removing it from any Z-Wave network, it is recommended that the GB00Z be reset. Reset the GB00Z by pressing the detector’s button 5 times. The detector’s green indicator will light for 3 seconds to show proper reset.

A simple press and release of the front button is used to include (green indicator blinks 3 times when complete), and the same to exclude (green indicator lights for 3 seconds when complete). The detector must be asleep for this action to take place.

### Exclusion Information

Before adding the device to any Z-Wave network, or after removing it from any Z-Wave network, it is recommended that the GB00Z be reset. Reset the GB00Z by pressing the detector’s button 5 times. The detector’s green indicator will light for 3 seconds to show proper reset.

A simple press and release of the front button is used to include (green indicator blinks 3 times when complete), and the same to exclude (green indicator lights for 3 seconds when complete). The detector must be asleep for this action to take place.

### Wakeup Information

The GB00Z does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Three presses will wake the device for five minutes so that you can begin any required network testing. You will see the green indicator blink three times to indicate it is awake for testing.

### General Usage Information

The sensor uses dual-stage digital audio processing to detect the sound of breaking glass in a 360° area around the device.

If breaking glass is detected, the sensor will send a signal to the Z-Wave gateway/ controller.

If the sensor’s batteries are low, a low battery signal is sent to the Z-Wave gateway/ controller.

The GB00Z Glass Break Detector should be tested at its mounted location with the system. Methods for testing the GB00Z Glass Break Detector will vary depending on the model of the Z-Wave gateway/controller and the system used to monitor the device.

  1. Refer to the systems instructions regarding testing the GB00Z Glass Break Detector after it is "paired" with the Z-Wave gateway/controller
  2. Press the include / exclude / test button three times when prompted

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the GB00Z -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Alarm (general)
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GB00Z supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

Alarms are reported to this group
Group 1 must be assigned the Node ID of the controller to which unsolicited notifications from the GB00Z-1 will be sent.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
