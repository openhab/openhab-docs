The LBR30Z-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Zwave Controlled Smart LED PAR38 Light Bulb, 650 Lumens, equivalentto a 65 Watt incandescent light bulb.

### Inclusion Information

Put controller into inclusion mode, turn the power to the light bulb socket ON.

### Exclusion Information

Set the Controller into “exclusion” mode. Reset the bulb by using the wall switch to turn the power to the bulb ON. The Smart LED Light Bulb will flash twice to confirm the exclusion

### General Usage Information

This unit must be added to the Network only where it will be permanently installed. The proper operation of this node in the mesh network is dependent on it knowing its location with respect to other nodes. You cannot “test bench” configure this unit, then install.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the LBR30Z-1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the LBR30Z-1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Dim Level Memory | Turn Dim Level Memory ON/OFF |
| 9 | Dim / Bright Step Level | How much the brightness will change with each dimming step |
| 10 | Dim / Bright Speed | How fast the brightness will change with each dimming step |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Dim Level Memory

Turn Dim Level Memory ON/OFF
By default, the LBR30Z-1 bulb will go to full brightness when turned on. To have the bulb turn on to the last dim level setting, set parameter 1 to 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable dim level memory |
| 1 | Enable dim level memory |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable dim level memory).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Dim / Bright Step Level

How much the brightness will change with each dimming step
When the brightness is adjusted by the controller/gateway, how much the bulb brightness will change is set by the programmed dimming step level.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Dim / Bright Speed

How fast the brightness will change with each dimming step
When the brightness is adjusted by the controller/gateway, how fast the bulb brightness will change is set by the programmed dimming step speed
Values in the range 1 to 10 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LBR30Z-1 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
