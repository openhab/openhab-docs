The POPE005206 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The POPE005206 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Z-Weather is a cup anemometer for Z-Wave installations. It continually measures the wind speed and can, for example, trigger closing of the awning and blinds if it is too windy. It also measures the amount of rotation, enabling calculation of the wind yield per day or per year. In addition, Z-Weather includes sensors for humidity, temperature, pressure and dew point, essentially providing the core sensors of a weather station.

### Inclusion Information

Push the button 3 times within 1.5 seconds.

The LED is blinking 3 times and the Network Information Frame (NIF) is sent to the Z-Wave network, adding Z-Weather to the network or removing it if it was previously added to the network.

### Exclusion Information

Push the button 3 times within 1.5 seconds.

The LED is blinking 3 times and the Network Information Frame (NIF) is sent to the Z-Wave network, adding Z-Weather to the network or removing it if it was previously added to the network.

### Wakeup Information

The POPE005206 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Push the button once within 1.5 seconds.

The LED blinks once indicating that Z-Weather is. Z-Weather sends a Z-Wave Wakeup-Notification if has been added to the network.

### General Usage Information

During normal operation, Z-Weather is limiting continuous measurement to wind speed and solar radiation, other sensors are operating only on demand. This conservative energy management ensures continuous operation with the limited energy harvested from the solar cell powering Z-Weather. The Z-Wave radio frequency transmitter is turned off most of the time and is turned on if there is too much wind, at twilight time and on a continuous base, depending on the energy budget. The wake up interval is between five minutes at noon in summer and five hours in the second half of the night in winter. Z-Weather also wakes up on pushing the button.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (velocity)
Indicates the current velocity.

The ```sensor_velocity``` channel is of type ```sensor_velocity``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (luminance)
Indicates the current light reading.

The ```sensor_luminance``` channel is of type ```sensor_luminance``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the POPE005206.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Wind Speed Action Threshold | Available Parameters: 0 - Off 1 - 30 in milliseconds Default = 6 m/s |
| 2 | Twilight Action Threshold | Set from 0 - 100 % Default = 37% (street lighting) |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Wind Speed Action Threshold

Available Parameters: 0 - Off 1 - 30 in milliseconds Default = 6 m/s

Values in the range 0 to 30 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Twilight Action Threshold

Set from 0 - 100 % Default = 37% (street lighting)

Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```37```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The POPE005206 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Wind Speed


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: End of Dawn


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: End of Dusk


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
