The ZHC5010 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

ZHC5010 is a wall switch module with Z-Wave communication. The module contains four buttons, four LEDs, a built-in relay switch and is designed to fit into a standard LK FUGA® wall box (one-module format). The ZHC5010 Wall Switch allows you to control the local load as well as Z-Wave connected devices in up to four additional Z-Wave groups.

Configuration updated: 2017-12-10, firmware 2.03

### Inclusion Information

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZHC5010 supports 21 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Send Basic Report (On/Off) when button #1 is used.


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
