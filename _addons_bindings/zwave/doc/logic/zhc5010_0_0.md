The ZHC5010 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

ZHC5010 is a wall switch module with Z-Wave communication. The module contains four buttons, four LEDs, a built-in relay switch and is designed to fit into a standard LK FUGAÂ® wall box (one-module format). The ZHC5010 Wall Switch allows you to control the local load as well as Z-Wave connected devices in up to four additional Z-Wave groups.

Configuration updated: 2017-03-12 14:35:03, firmware 1.09

### Inclusion Information

Place your primary controller in Adding Mode by following the manufacturer's instructions, then activate the add mode on the device by triple-clicking the upper left button on the module, or by triple-clicking the little button in the middle of the module (hidden behind the small plastic cover). Adding Mode is indicated by blinking of upper left LED until the timeout occurs after 10 seconds or the module has been added in the network.

### Exclusion Information
