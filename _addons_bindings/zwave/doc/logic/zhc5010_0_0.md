The ZHC5010 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

ZHC5010 is a wall switch module with Z-Wave communication. The module contains four buttons, four LEDs, a built-in relay switch and is designed to fit into a standard LK FUGA® wall box (one-module format). The ZHC5010 Wall Switch allows you to control the local load as well as Z-Wave connected devices in up to four additional Z-Wave groups.

Configuration updated: 2017-03-12 14:35:03, firmware 1.09

### Inclusion Information
