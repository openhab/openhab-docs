The ZIF5029 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ZIF5029 DIN-rail module is a device with a wireless Z-Wave communication protocol. It has 6 relay driven outputs and 6 pulse inputs (S0). The unit is a multi-purpose Z-Wave I/O module, which can be used for many applications. E.g. the module provides the possibility to control other systems via the Z-Wave network, by utilizing the 6 outputs as a kind of hand-over function to another automation system.

### Inclusion Information

Upon delivery, the ZIF5029 module has not been enrolled into any Z-Wave network. To communicate with other devices in the Z-Wave network, ZIF5029 must be enrolled in the network. This process is called to include the device in the Z-Wave network. Devices can also be removed from the Z-Wave network if they are to be used in another installation. This is called to exclude the device from the Z-Wave network.

Both processes are initiated by setting the central network controls in either inclusion or exclusion mode. Please refer to the network controller's manual how to set the central controls in either inclusion or exclusion mode.

The inclusion / exclusion mode on the ZIF5029 device is activated by pressing the small button through the hole in the front of the module, marked "INCLUSION", after which the status LED will start flashing.

If the device already belongs to a network, the device must be excluded before it can be included in the current network, otherwise the inclusion process will fail.

Furthermore, see section 3 above about maintaining configuration parameters during exclusion / inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

See inclusion section.

### General Usage Information

The relay outputs can be controlled from the Z-Wave network, and are suitable for switching up to 6 230Vac loads. When connecting to SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) and 230Vac power circuits for relay outputs, relays must be considered as two groups, where the first group includes output 1 to 3 and the second group includes the outputs 4 to 6. If one of the relays in the group is connected to a SELV circuit, the remaining outputs are not allowed to be connected to 230Vac or another circuit which is not a SELV circuit. This ensurescomplete separation between the SELV and 230Vac circuits.

For example, the relay outputs can be used to control the 230Vac power supply outlet, making it possible toturn on and disconnect the electrical outlets directly through the Z-Wave network. For safety reasons,however, it is recommended not to use the ZIF5029 to plug electrical outlets that are normally used for hazardous tools and machinery.

The 6 pulse inputs can be used for counting pulses from utility meters such as water meters and electricity meters with an output that generates pulses when a specific consumption measure has been reached. E.g. a water meter can generate a pulse per liter passing through the meter or 1,000 pulses per m 3 water. ZIF5029 can translate these pulses to a Command Class Metering Report which is sent over the Z-Wave network.

All 6 inputs can be used for different utility meters. For instance, input 1 can be connected to an electricity meter, input 2 to a water meter and so on. It is possible to individually configure the utility meter type connected to each input.

In addition, the ZIF5029 also acts as a repeater, thus extending the range of the Z-Wave network.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZIF5029 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline group for the entire module.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
