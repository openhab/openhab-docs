The LHC5031 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

LHC 5031 Z-Wave DIN rail module, is a module that clips right onto a DIN rail to add a variety of functions to your wireless Z-Wave network.

LHC5031 is equipped with 10 relay outputs and 4 analogue inputs, and a Z-Wave radio for interfacing to the wireless Z-Wave network. The module can be power supplied from a 230V AC mains connectio, and is able to deliver an output supply of 24V DC.

LHC5031 inputs are able to be freely controlled from the Z-Wave network, and can be used for several purposes, e.g. on/off control of light, control of valve actuators for an underfloor heating system, or control of other home automation systems.

LHC5031 inputs are analogue inputs for interfacing simple temperature sensors; NTC, PT1000, etc.

It is possible to configure the level- and the indication of the status indicator LED in the front of the LHC5031 module.

The device is also known as: Multireg Z-Water from Thermo-Floor.

### Inclusion Information
