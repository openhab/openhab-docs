# FGMS001 Motion Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGMS001*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgms001_00_000```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions below 2.8

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The FGMS001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGMS001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Fibaro Motion Sensor is a universal Z-Wave multi-sensor. Along with detecting motion the device measures the temperature and light  
intensity.

 The sensor has a built-in accelerometer to detect any tampering of the device. The Fibaro Motion Sensor is battery powered device and designed to be installed quckly and easily on any surface.

### Inclusion Information

1\) Insert the battery into the Fibaro Motion Sensor. Enclosure lock is  
marked with a dot. Make sure the device is located within the direct  
range of the main controller.  
2\) Set the main controller into the learning mode (see main  
controller’s operating manual).  
3\) Quickly, triple click the B-button - LED diode will glow blue.  
4\) Fibaro Motion Sensor will be detected and included in the Z-Wave  
network.  
5\) Wait for the main controller to configure the sensor.  
6\) If necessary, wake up the Motion Sensor by triple clicking the  
B-button.  
7\) LED diode will glow blue to confirm the sensor woke up, and then  
wait for the main controller to configure the sensor

### Exclusion Information

1\) Set the main controller into the exclusion mode (see main  
controller’s operating manual).  
2\) Quickly, triple click the B-button - LED diode will glow blue.  
3\) Fibaro Motion Sensor will be excluded from the Z-Wave  
network.

### Wakeup Information

The FGMS001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Quickly, triple click the B-button - LED diode will glow blue.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGMS001 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Device Status


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 2: Tamper Alarm


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Controller Updates


This group supports 1 nodes.
