## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGWPB-121 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reports the device status.
1st Association Group – “Lifeline” (for root, endpoint 1 and 2) reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off (Button)

On or off when relay status is changed using the button.
2nd Association Group – “On/Off (Button)” (for root and endpoint 1) devices in this group will be switched on or off when relay status is changed using the button (uses Basic command class). 

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/Off (Plug power)

Switched On/Off based on the current load of plugged device.
3rd Association Group – “On/Off (Plug power)” (for root and endpoint 1) devices in this group will be switched on or off depending on the current load of plugged device (uses Basic command class).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
