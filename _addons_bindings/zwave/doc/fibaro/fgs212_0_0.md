The FGS212 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Remotely Controlled Relay Switch of Fibaro System is designed to operate in a wall switch box or in locations where the control of an electric device is needed.

### Inclusion Information

Fibaro Switch must be placed within the range of Home Center  
controller, as adding mode requires direct communication with the  
controller.  
  
Find key no. 1 which allows to switch circuit 1 on, in accordance  
with the diagram  
During the installation it is recommended to use a  
momentary key connected to S1.  
  
Add Fibaro Switch to the network by pushing three times key no. 1  
or push-button B located inside the housing of the device. For  
toggle switch perform 3 position changes.  
  
The controller indicates when the device is correctly added to the  
network.  
  
**CAUTION**  
Fibaro Switch cancels the "learning" mode after  
key no. 1 is pressed once. Therefore, pressing key  
no. 1 four times will not add the devices to the  
network. The same applies to push-button B.

### Exclusion Information

Find key no. 1 which allows to switch circuit 1 on, in accordance  
with the diagram  
During removing it is recommended to use a  
momentary key connected to S1.  
  
Remove Fibaro Switch from the network by pushing three times key no. 1  
or push-button B located inside the housing of the device. For  
toggle switch perform 3 position changes.  
  
The controller indicates when the device is correctly removed from the  
network.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGS212 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Switch 1


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 2: Switch 2


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Controller Updates


This group supports 1 nodes.
