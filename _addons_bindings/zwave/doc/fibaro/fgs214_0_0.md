The FGS214 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The remotely operated FIBARO  Smart  Module  and  Double  Smart  Module are designed to turn electrical devices or circuits on and off. Smart Module allows to control one device or circuit. The compact size of the device allows for the product to be installed in the housings of other devices. The devices can be controlled either via the Z-Wave™ network or with buttons connected directly to them.  
  
Main features:

  * Works with various types of switches and buttons.
  * Supports Z-Wave network Security Modes: S0 with AES-128 en-cryption and S2 Authenticated with PRNG-based encryption.
  * Works as a Z-Wave signal repeater (all non-battery operated de-vices within the network will act as repeaters to increase reliabili-ty of the network).
  * May be used with all devices certified with the Z-Wave Plus™ certificate and should be compatible with such devices produced by other manufacturers.

The device is a Security Enabled Z-Wave Plus product and  a  Security  Enabled  Z-Wave  Controller  must  be used in order to fully utilize the product.

### Inclusion Information

Fibaro Switch must be placed within the range of Home Center  
controller, as adding mode requires direct communication with the  
controller.  
  
Find key no. 1 which allows to switch circuit 1 on, in accordance  
with the diagram  
During the installation it is recommended to use a  
momentary key connected to S1.  
  
Add Fibaro Switch to the network by pushing three times key no. 1  
or push-button B located inside the housing of the device. For  
toggle switch perform 3 position changes.  
  
The controller indicates when the device is correctly added to the  
network.  
  
**CAUTION**  
Fibaro Switch cancels the "learning" mode after  
key no. 1 is pressed once. Therefore, pressing key  
no. 1 four times will not add the devices to the  
network. The same applies to push-button B.

### Exclusion Information

Find key no. 1 which allows to switch circuit 1 on, in accordance  
with the diagram  
During removing it is recommended to use a  
momentary key connected to S1.  
  
Remove Fibaro Switch from the network by pushing three times key no. 1  
or push-button B located inside the housing of the device. For  
toggle switch perform 3 position changes.  
  
The controller indicates when the device is correctly removed from the  
network.

### General Usage Information

#  
7: Operating the device

  
7.1: Controlling channels with inputs  
  
Momentary switch (parameter 20 set to 0):  
  
1x click – change the state of the channel to the opposite one  
  
Toggle switch without memory (parameter 20 set to 1):  
  
1x switch – change the state of the channel to the state of the switch (OFF if contacts opened, ON if contacts closed)  
  
Toggle switch with memory (parameter 20 set to 2):  
  
1x switch – change the state of the channel to the opposite one  
  
By default S1 input controls 1st channel and S2 input controls 2nd channel if present. It can be changed using parameters 24 and 25.  
  
By default outputs are set as NO (normally open).  It means the contacts will be opened when turned off and closed when turned on. It can be switched to NC (normally closed), which means the contacts will be closed when turned off and opened when turned on using parameters 162/163.  
  
7.2: Visual indications  
  
The built-in LED light shows current device status.  
  
After powering the device:  
- Green – device added to a Z-Wave network (non-secure, S0, S2 non-authenticated),  
- Magenta – device added to a Z-Wave network (Security S2 Authenticated),  
- Red – device not added to a Z-Wave network.  
  
Update:  
- Blinking cyan – update in progress,  
- Green – update successful,  
- Red – update not successful.  
  
Menu:  
- Blinking green – entering the menu (added as non-secure, S0, S2 non-authenticated),  
- Blinking magenta – entering the menu (added as Security S2 Authenticated),  
- Blinking red – entering the menu (not added to a Z-Wave network),  
- Magenta – test Z-Wave network range,  
- Yellow – reset to factory defaults.  
  
  
7.3: Menu  
  
Menu allows to perform Z-Wave network actions. In order to use the menu:  
1. Press and hold the maintenance button to enter the menu.  
2. LED will signal adding status for 3 seconds (see 7.2: Visual indications), then turn off for another 3 seconds.  
3. Release the button when device signals desired position with colour:  
- Magenta – test Z-Wave network range  
- Yellow – reset to factory defaults  
4. Quickly click the button to confirm.  
  
7.4: Resetting to factory defaults  
  
Reset procedure allows to restore the device back to its factory settings, which means all information about the Z-Wave controller and user configuration will be deleted. Make sure that restoring the parameters to factory defaults will not result in damaging the connected device, we recommend disconnecting it first.  
  
Resetting the device is not the recommended way of removing the device from the Z-Wave network. Use reset procedure only if the primary controller is missing or inoperable. Certain device removal can be achieved by the procedure of removing described.  
  
1. Press and hold the maintenance button to enter the menu.  
2. Release button when the device glows yellow.  
3. Quickly click the button to confirm.  
4. After few seconds the device will be restarted, which is signalled with red LED colour.

#  
8: Z-Wave range test

  
  
The device has a built in Z-Wave network main controller’s range tester.  To make Z-Wave range test possible, the device must be added to the Z-Wave controller. Testing may stress the network, so it is recommended to perform the test only in special cases.  
  
To test the main controller’s range:  
  
1. Press and hold the maintenance button to enter the menu.  
2. Release button when the device glows magenta.  
3. Quickly click the button to confirm.  
4. Visual indicator will indicate the Z-Wave network’s range (range signaling modes described below).  
5. To exit Z-Wave range test, press the button briefly.  
  
Z-Wave range tester signalling modes:  
- Visual indicator pulsing green - the device attempts to establish a direct communication with the main controller. If a direct communication attempt fails, the device will try to establish a routed communication, through other modules, which will be signalled by visual indicator pulsing yellow.  
- Visual indicator glowing green - the device communicates with the main controller directly.  (Visual indicator pulsing yellow - the device tries to establish a routed communication with the main controller through other modules (repeaters).  
- Visual indicator glowing yellow - the device communicates with the main controller through the other modules. After 2 seconds the device will retry to establish a direct communication with the main controller, which will be signalled with visual indicator pulsing green.  
- Visual indicator pulsing violet - the device does communicate at the maximum distance of the Z-Wave network. If connection proves successful it will be confirmed with a yellow glow. It’s not recommended to use the device at the range limit.  
- Visual indicator glowing red - the device is not able to connect to the main controller directly or through another Z-Wave network device (repeater).  
  
Communication mode of the device may switch between direct and one using routing, especially if the device is on the limit of the direct range.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGS214 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device status and al-lows for assigning single device only
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and al-lows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off

Turn the associated devices on/off
2nd association group –  “On/Off” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting input operation (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
