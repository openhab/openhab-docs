The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Default flood sensor operation ).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_77_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGFS101 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Flood Alarm


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Tilt & Tamper Sensors


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Device Status


Association group 3 supports 1 node.
