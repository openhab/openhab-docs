The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_76_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_77_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGFS101 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Flood Alarm


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Tilt & Tamper Sensors


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Device Status


This group supports 1 nodes.
