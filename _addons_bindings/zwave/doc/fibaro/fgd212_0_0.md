## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGD212 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Send BASIC SET command class frame S1


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame S1


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Sends BASIC SET command class S2


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame S2


This group supports 10 nodes.
