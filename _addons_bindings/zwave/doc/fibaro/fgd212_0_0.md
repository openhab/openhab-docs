## Overview

FIBARO Dimmer 2 remotely controlled light dimming module is designed to work with  
various  types  of  light  sources.  It  may  be  connected  to  two-wire  or   
three-wire  configuration  so  it  can  operate  with  or  without  neutral   
lead.    FIBARO  Dimmer  2  can  switch  or  dim  connected  light  source   
either  through  radio  waves  or  through  the  wall  switch  connected   
directly to it.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGD212 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

This group supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Send BASIC SET command class frame S1


2nd Association Group „On/Oﬀ (S1)” is assigned to switch no. 1.  
Sends BASIC command class frame according to the state of the device
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame S1


3rd Association Group „Dimmer (S1)” is assigned to switch no. 1.  
Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame. Allows sending  
dim/brighten command to associated devices.
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Sends BASIC SET command class S2


4th Association Group „On/Oﬀ (S2)” is assigned to switch no. 2.  
Sends BASIC command class frame according to the state of the device.  
 
This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame S2


5th Association Group „Dimmer (S2)” is assigned to switch no. 2.  
Sends MulTIlEVEl SWITCH command class frame. Allows sending  
dim/brighten command to associated devices.  
 
This group supports 10 nodes.
