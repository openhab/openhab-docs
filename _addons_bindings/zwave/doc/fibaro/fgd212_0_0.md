| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (Hardware Fail)
Appearing of an error may be a result of serious hardware failure of the Dimmer 2. In this case the Dimmer 2 sets the maximum brightness level and the LED visual indicator starts blinking in red. All external actions (Z-Wave commands, pressing the switches, menu settings) will be ignored.

We recommend disconnecting the device from the power supply and contacting the customer service or to initiate the guarantee procedure.

This error may also appear as a result of enabling the Dimmer 2 without load connected to the output in 3-wire connection. It is not a dangerous situation. We recommend disabling the fuse, connecting the load and enabling the fuse again.

### Alarm (Power)
**LOAD ERROR**

Dimmer 2 is equipped with functionality of detecting the burnt out bulb. In case of such situation, Dimmer 2 sends the notification about load failure. Described function is not available for values of parameter 58 different than 0. Power variation is detected in accordance with the settings of parameters 15 and 16.

**SURGE ERROR**

Appearing of an error may be the result of electrical surges, incorrect load control (inductive load controlled in trailing edge mode) or connecting the prohibited type of load.

**OVERCURRENT ERROR**

Appearing of an error may also be the result of rapid powering on the load. It may also occur if the soft-start functionality is disabled (parameter 34 set to 0) or as a result of the short circuit.

If parameter 37 is set to 1, the device will automatically try to turn on again. If described error has been caused by the rapid powering on the load, then FIBARO Dimmer 2 will return to normal operation after reenabling. After three unsuccessful automatic tries of turning on the load, Dimmer 2 will stay in OVERCURRENT error mode (module turned off ). In such situation, it is required to remove the failure (possible short circuit in the installation.) Otherwise, it is recommended to set the long soft-start (parameter 34 set to 2).

**OVERLOAD ERROR**

Appearing of an error is a result of connecting receivers with too much power consumption. In this case FIBARO Dimmer 2 will automatically turn off the lighting. It is required to reduce power consumption of connected load (e.g. by reducing the number of receivers) and turn on the light source again by the wall switch or a Z-Wave command.

**VOLTAGE DROP ERROR**

Appearing of an error in a 2-wire connection may be the result of mains voltage drop or a too high brightness level of the light source. If parameter 37 is set to 1, the device will automatically try to turn on again. Voltage drop error suggests that parameter 2 value should be reduced until disappearing of the failure. You can also recalibrate the load using parameter 13. After three unsuccessful automatic tries of turning on the load, Dimmer 2 will stay in VOLTAGE DROP error mode (module turned off ).

Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGD212 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Send BASIC SET command class frame S1

2nd Association Group „On/Oﬀ (S1)” is assigned to switch no. 1.  
Sends BASIC command class frame according to the state of the device

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame S1

3rd Association Group „Dimmer (S1)” is assigned to switch no. 1.  
Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame. Allows sending  
dim/brighten command to associated devices.

Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Sends BASIC SET command class S2

4th Association Group „On/Oﬀ (S2)” is assigned to switch no. 2.  
Sends BASIC command class frame according to the state of the device.  
 

Association group 4 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Sends MULTILEVEL SWITCH command class frame S2

5th Association Group „Dimmer (S2)” is assigned to switch no. 2.  
Sends MulTIlEVEl SWITCH command class frame. Allows sending  
dim/brighten command to associated devices.  
 

Association group 5 supports 10 nodes.
