## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the FGT001.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Override Schedule duration | Duration of Override Schedule after turning knob |
| 2 | Additional functions | This parameter allows to enable different additional functions of the device. |
| 3 | Additional functions status (READ-ONLY) | This parameter allows to check statuses of different additional functions. |

### Parameter 1: Override Schedule duration

Duration of Override Schedule after turning knob
This parameter determines duration of Override Schedule after turning the knob while normal schedule is active (set by Schedule CC).

Units = minutes
Values in the range 10 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```240```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Additional functions

This parameter allows to enable different additional functions of the device.
Parameter 2 values may be combined, e.g. 1+8=9 means that Open Window Detector and LED indications when controlling remotely are enabled.

1 (bit 0) - enable Open Window Detector

2 (bit 1) - enable fast Open Window Detector

4 (bit 2) - increase receiver sensitivity (shortens battery life)

8 (bit 3) - enabled LED indications when controlling remotely

16 (bit 4) - protect from setting Full ON and Full OFF mode by turning the knob manually
Values in the range 0 to 31 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Additional functions status (READ-ONLY)

This parameter allows to check statuses of different additional functions.
Parameter 3 values may be combined, e.g. 1+2=3 means optional sensor works properly and open window detection was triggered.

1 (bit 0) - optional temperature sensor connected and operational

2 (bit 1) - open window detected
Values in the range 0 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGT001 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline association group that reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default)

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
