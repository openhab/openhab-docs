# FGT-001 Thermostatic Valve
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGT-001*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgt001_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Radiator Control*, defining Controls on radiators used to heat up rooms.

The FGT-001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

FIBARO Heat Controller is a remotely controlled thermostatic head to control temperature in the room. It measures the temperature and automatically adjust the heat level. It can be mounted without tools on three types of thermostatic radiator valves. It is also possible to create schedules via app to easily manage temperature throughout the week.   
Main features:   
• to be installed on three types of valves: M30 x 1.5, Danfoss RTD-N and Danfoss RA-N,   
• compatible with any Z-Wave or Z-Wave+ Controller,   
• supports Z-Wave network Security Modes: S0 with AES-128 encryption and S2 with PRNG-based encryption,   
• built-in battery recharged through standard micro-USB port,   
• easy installation - no tools required,   
• can use dedicated temperature sensor,   
• supports heating schedules,   
• automatic calibration,   
• anti-freeze function,   
• decalc function,   
• unconstrained rotation spherical knob to set desired temperature.

### Inclusion Information

Add the device to the Z-Wave network:

1\. Make sure the device is within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.

2\. Set the main controller in (security/non-security) add mode.

3\. Use the included key to quickly triple click the button on the thermostatic head.

4\. The LED ring will start blinking white.

5\. If you are adding in S2 authenticated mode, type in the device pin code (underlined part of the public key on the label).

6\. Wait for the adding process to end.

7\. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller.

### Exclusion Information

To remove the device from the Z-Wave network:

1\. Make sure the device is within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.

2\. Set the main controller into remove mode.

3\. Use the included key to quickly triple click the button on the thermostatic head.

4\. The LED ring will start blinking white.

5\. Wait for the removing process to end.

6\. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller.

### Wakeup Information

FIBARO Heat Controller is a FLiRS device. The FLiRS device alternates between sleep mode and a partially awake mode in which it is listening beam signal. When device receives this beam, it immediately fully wakes up and then communicates with the controller or other Z-Wave device.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the FGT-001.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Override Schedule duration | This parameter determines duration of Override Schedule after turning the knob while normal schedule is active (set by Schedule CC). |
| 2 | Additional functions | This parameter allows to enable different additional functions of the device. |
| 3 | Additional functions status (READ-ONLY) | This parameter allows to check statuses of different additional functions. |

### Parameter 1: Override Schedule duration

This parameter determines duration of Override Schedule after turning the knob while normal schedule is active (set by Schedule CC).
Units = minutes
Values in the range 10 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```240```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Additional functions

This parameter allows to enable different additional functions of the device.
Parameter 2 values may be combined, e.g. 1+8=9 means that Open Window Detector and LED indications when controlling remotely are enabled.

1 (bit 0) - enable Open Window Detector

2 (bit 1) - enable fast Open Window Detector

4 (bit 2) - increase receiver sensitivity (shortens battery life)

8 (bit 3) - enabled LED indications when controlling remotely

16 (bit 4) - protect from setting Full ON and Full OFF mode by turning the knob manually
Values in the range 0 to 31 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Additional functions status (READ-ONLY)

This parameter allows to check statuses of different additional functions.
Parameter 3 values may be combined, e.g. 1+2=3 means optional sensor works properly and open window detection was triggered.

1 (bit 0) - optional temperature sensor connected and operational

2 (bit 1) - open window detected
Values in the range 0 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGT-001 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Lifeline
This group supports 5 nodes.
