The FGRM222 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Fibaro Roller Shutter is a universal, Z-Wave compatible, electric motor controller. The device allows for controlling motors of roller blinds, awnings, venetian blinds, gates and others, which are single phase AC powered. Fibaro Roller Shutter allows for precise positioning of a roller blind or venetian blind lamellas. Precise positioning is available for the motors equipped with mechanic and electronic end switches.

The module may be controlled wirelessly, through the Z-Wave network main controller, or through the switch keys connected to it. It’s also possible to combine few devices into groups of devices, which then can be controlled simultaneously. In addition, Fibaro Roller Shutter is equipped with Power Metering.

**ROLLER SHUTTER RESET**

Reset procedure clears the modules’ EPROM memory, including all information about the Z-Wave network controller, calibration and power consumption data.

1. Make sure the module is connected to the power supply.
2. Press and hold the B-button for ca. 14 seconds.
3. LED indicator will glow yellow.
4. Release the B-button and press it again, briefly.
5. The Roller Shutter memory is now empty.
6. The module goes into the auto inclusion mode, until any button is pushed.

### Inclusion Information

Fibaro Roller Shutter may be included into the Z-Wave network via the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal. In addition, the module may be included in auto inclusion mode, by simply connecting the power supply.

**Automatic Z-Wave network inclusion:**

1. Make sure the power supply is disconnected and a Roller Shutter is located within a direct Z-Wave network’s main controller communication range.
2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
3. Connect the power supply to include the Roller Shutter in auto inclusion mode.
4. Fibaro Roller Shutter will be automatically detected and included into the Z-Wave network.

To disable the auto inclusion mode, press the B-button briefly, after connecting the module to the power supply.

**Manual Z-Wave network inclusion:**

1. Connect the power supply.
2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
3. Triple click the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal.
4. Fibaro Roller Shutter will be detected and included into the Z-Wave network

### Exclusion Information

Excluding Fibaro Roller Shutter from the Z-Wave network:

1. Make sure the module is connected to the power supply.
2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
3. Triple click the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal.
