# FGFS101 Flood Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGFS101*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgfs101_23_023```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions above 23.23

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The FGFS101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGFS101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

**FIBARO Flood Sensor** is a universal, Z-Wave Plus compatible, flood and temperature sensor. The device can be powered using battery, 12/24V DC power supply or both. Flood alarm is sent to the Z-Wave network devices or additionally to any external system through opening a NC contact using the external power supply.

The device has built in temperature sensor that allows to monitor ambient temperature. FIBARO Flood Sensor is designed to be placed on the floor or mounted on a wall (in this case Flood Sensor probes should be extended using addition wire). The device has a built-in visual LED indicator and an acoustic alarm.

In addition, the sensor is equipped with a tilt sensor reporting tilt or movement to the main controller e.g. when someone has taken the Sensor from its original location. 

FIBARO Flood Sensor is sink-proof, which means it drifts on the water surface and keeps on sending alarm signal in case of substantial inundation of water.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Open the cover.
  2. Place the Sensor within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
  3. Set the main controller in (security/non-security) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  4. Quickly, three times press the TMP button.

### Exclusion Information

Quickly, three times press the TMP button.

### Wakeup Information

The FGFS101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Quickly, three times press the TMP button.

## Channels

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGFS101 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Flood Alarm


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Tilt Sensor


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Device Status


Association group 3 supports 1 node.
