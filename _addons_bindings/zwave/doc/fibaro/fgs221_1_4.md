## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGS221 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Switch 1


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 2: Switch 2


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Controller Updates


This group supports 1 nodes.
