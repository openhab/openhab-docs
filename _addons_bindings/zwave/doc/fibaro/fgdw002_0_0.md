The FGDW002 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGDW002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

FIBARO Door/Window Sensor 2 is a wireless, battery powered Hall effect contact sensor, compatible with the Z-Wave Plus standard. Changing the device’s status will automatically send signal to the Z-Wave controller and associated devices.

Sensor can be used to trigger scenes and wherever there is a need for information about opening or closing of doors, windows, garage doors, etc. Opening is detected by separating the sensor’s body and the magnet.

In addition the FIBARO Door/Window Sensor 2 is equipped with a built-in temperature sensor.

**Main features of FIBARO Door/Window Sensor 2**

- Compatible with any Z-Wave or Z-Wave+ Controller,
- Supports protected mode (Z-Wave network Security Mode) with AES-128 encryption
- Door/window opening detected through separation of Sensor’s body and a magnet
- Built-in temperature sensor
- Detects tampering, when detached or opened
- Easily mounted on doors, windows, garage gates and roller blinds
- Battery powered
- Visual LED indicator signalling status of the device
- 7 color variations.

### Inclusion Information

1. Place the Door/Window Sensor 2 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
2. Set the main controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
3. Quickly, three times press one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).
4. Wait for the adding process to end.
5. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Exclusion Information

1. Place the Door/Window Sensor 2 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
2. Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).
3. Quickly, three times press one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).
4. Wait for the removing process to end.
5. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Wakeup Information

The FGDW002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Available settings: 0 or 3600-64800 (in seconds (1-18h), 3600s (1h) step). Default setting: 21600 seconds (6h)

The Door/Window Sensor will wake up after each defined time interval and always try to connect with the main controller. After a successful communication attempt, the sensor will update configuration parameters, associations and settings and will go into standby mode.

After failed communication attempt (e.g. lack of Z-Wave range) the device will go into standby mode and retry to establish connection with the main controller after the next time interval.

Setting wake up interval to 0 disables sending Wake Up Notification frame automatically. Wake up may be still performed manually by a clicking one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_56_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGDW002 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off

is assigned to the device status - Hall effect sensor (sends Basic Set command frames)
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Tamper

is assigned to the TMP switch (sends alarm command frames)
This group supports 5 nodes.
