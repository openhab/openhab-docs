The FGDW002 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGDW002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

FIBARO Door/Window Sensor 2 is a wireless, battery powered Hall effect contact sensor, compatible with the Z-Wave Plus standard. Changing the device’s status will automatically send signal to the Z-Wave controller and associated devices.

Sensor can be used to trigger scenes and wherever there is a need for information about opening or closing of doors, windows, garage doors, etc. Opening is detected by separating the sensor’s body and the magnet.

In addition the FIBARO Door/Window Sensor 2 is equipped with a built-in temperature sensor.

**Main features of FIBARO Door/Window Sensor 2**

  * Compatible with any Z-Wave or Z-Wave+ Controller,
  * Supports protected mode (Z-Wave network Security Mode) with AES-128 encryption
  * Door/window opening detected through separation of Sensor’s body and a magnet
  * Built-in temperature sensor
  * Detects tampering, when detached or opened
  * Easily mounted on doors, windows, garage gates and roller blinds
  * Battery powered
  * Visual LED indicator signalling status of the device
  * 7 color variations.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Place the Door/Window Sensor 2 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
  2. Set the main controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly, three times press one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).
  4. Wait for the adding process to end.
  5. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Place the Door/Window Sensor 2 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
  2. Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly, three times press one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).
  4. Wait for the removing process to end.
  5. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Wakeup Information

The FGDW002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Available settings: 0 or 3600-64800 (in seconds (1-18h), 3600s (1h) step). Default setting: 21600 seconds (6h)

The Door/Window Sensor will wake up after each defined time interval and always try to connect with the main controller. After a successful communication attempt, the sensor will update configuration parameters, associations and settings and will go into standby mode.

After failed communication attempt (e.g. lack of Z-Wave range) the device will go into standby mode and retry to establish connection with the main controller after the next time interval.

Setting wake up interval to 0 disables sending Wake Up Notification frame automatically. Wake up may be still performed manually by a clicking one of the TMP buttons (while the other button is pressed).

### General Usage Information

**Resetting the Door/Window Sensor 2: **

Reset procedure allows to restore the device back to its factory settings, which means all information about the Z-Wave controller and user configuration will be deleted. In order to reset the device:

  1. Open the cover.
  2. Remove the battery.
  3. Install the battery while holding both TMP buttons.
  4. Visual  LED  indicator  will  be  flashing  slowly  for  5  seconds - keep holding the buttons.
  5. Release one button when the LED indicator starts flashing quickly.  
  6. Click released button once to confirm launching of reset procedure.
  7. Wait a few seconds until a long blink of the LED indicator. Do not remove the battery.
  8. Visual LED indicator will blink 5 times quickly to confirm the reset.

**NOTE**

Resetting the device is not the recommended way of removing the device from the Z-Wave network. Use reset procedure only if the primary controller is missing or inoperable. Certain device removal can be achieved by the procedure of removing described in “Adding/removing the device”.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGDW002 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off

is assigned to the device status - Hall effect sensor (sends Basic Set command frames)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Tamper
