## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGS223 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off (S1)

On/Off (S1) is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Basic command class)
2nd association group – “On/Off (S1)” is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimmer (S1)

“Dimmer (S1)” is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class)
“Dimmer (S1)” is assigned to switch connected to the S1 terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class)

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: On/Off (S2)

On/Off (S2) is assigned to switch connected to the S2 terminal (uses Basic command class)
On/Off (S2) is assigned to switch connected to the S2 terminal (uses Basic command class)

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Dimmer (S2)

Dimmer (S2) is assigned to switch connected to the S2 terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class)
Dimmer (S2) is assigned to switch connected to the S2 terminal (uses Switch Multilevel command class)

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
