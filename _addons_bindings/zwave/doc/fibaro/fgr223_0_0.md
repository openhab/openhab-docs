### Inclusion Information

Adding (Inclusion) – Z-Wave device learning mode, allowing to add the device to existing Z-Wave network.

To add the device to the Z-Wave network using Smart Start:

  1. Set the main controller in Security S2 Authenticated add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  2. Scan the DSK QR code or input the underlined part of the DSK (label on the bottom of the box).  
    (on the device label).
  3. Power the device (turn on the mains voltage).
  4. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the adding process to end.
  5. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

To add the device to the Z-Wave network manually:

  1. Power the device.
  2. Identify the S1 switch.
  3. Set the main controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  4. Quickly, triple click the S1 switch.
  5. If you are adding in Security S2, scan the DSK QR code or input the underlined part of the DSK (label on the bottom of the box)
  6. Wait for the adding process to end.
  7. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

In case of problems with adding using the S1 switch, use B-button instead (located on the housing).  
SmartStart enabled products can be added to SmartStart enabled Z-Wave controller by scanning the Z-Wave QR Code present on the product. SmartStart product will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network range.

### Exclusion Information

Removing (Exclusion) – Z-Wave device learning mode, allowing to remove the device from existing Z-Wave network. Removing the device restores all the default parameters of the device, but does not reset power metering data.

To remove the device from the Z-Wave network:

  1. Make sure the device is powered.
  2. Identify the S1 switch.
  3. Set the main controller in remove mode (see the controller’s manual).

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGR223 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Roller Shutter

Shutter position control
"Roller Shutter" is assigned to shutter position control – UP/DOWN (uses Switch Multilevel command class).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Slats

Slats position control
"Slats" is assigned to slats position control – UP/DOWN (uses Switch Multilevel command class).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
