This version of the device is limited to firmware versions above 3.2

The device is in the category of *Smoke Detector*, defining Smoke detectors.

The FGSD002 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGSD002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Fibaro Smoke Sensor is a universal, optical Z-Wave smoke detector. Fire alarm is signaled by sound, visual indicator blinking and by sending Z-Wave alarm and control commands.

### Inclusion Information

  * Install the battery. Visual indicator will signal the Z-Wave network inclusion status (red - device ready for inclusion, green - device included, remove firstly - see p. II).
  * Make sure the device is located within direct range of the Z-Wave controller.
  * Set the main controller into the learning mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
  * Quickly, triple click the B-button, located on Fibaro Smoke Sensor’s casing.
  * Fibaro Smoke Sensor will be detected and included in the Z-Wave network

### Exclusion Information

  * Make sure the sensor is connected to battery.
  * Set the main controller into the learning mode (see main controller’s operating manual)
  * Quickly, triple click the B-button, located on Fibaro Smoke Sensor’s casing.

### Wakeup Information

The FGSD002 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Click the B-button once to wakeup the device. Minimum wake-interval accepted by the device is 4200.

### General Usage Information

**BATTERY REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE**  
Once a Fibaro Smoke Sensor has reported low battery level or battery is  
discharged, it should be replaced observing the following procedure:

  1. Detach the sensor from its cover by turning the device counter-clockwise.
  2. Remove the flat battery from the device. Then press and hold the B-button for 3 seconds.
  3. Insert a new CR123A battery observing the polarities shown inside. Visual indicator will signal Z-Wave network inclusion status (green - device included, red - device not included).
  4. Test Fibaro Smoke Sensor’s operation by performing a self-test (see p. VI).
  5. Attach the device into the cover by turning clockwise.

**Self-test may be triggered manually**

  1. Make sure the device is powered by the battery
  2. Press and hold the B-button. The visual indicator will glow white and the short alarm will sound. Keep holding the B-button. After 3 seconds from the first beep smoke chamber operation will be checked.

Triggering fire alarm and beep mean positive result and should occur within 10 seconds. No fire alarm means that the sensor is malfunctioning.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_32_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGSD002 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Smoke Alarm

Sending the BASIC SET control command once smoke is detected. Its value may be modified in advanced parameters. Group may control up to five on/off devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Tamper Alarm TYPE = BURGLAR, EVENT

Sending the notification NOTIFICATION REPORT (TYPE = BURGLAR, EVENT = PRODUCT COVERING REMOVED) to associated devices once casing opening is detected. Up to five devices supporting casing opening command (NOTIFICATION REPORT) may be included in this group.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Fire Alarm

Sending the notification SENSOR ALARM REPORT (TYPE= SMOKE ALARM) to associated devices once smoke is detected. Up to five devices supporting SMOKE ALARM command may be included in this group

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Tamper Alarm TYPE = GENERAL

Sending SENSOR ALARM REPORT notification (TYPE = GENERAL) to associated devices once casing opening is detected. Up to five devices supporting SENSOR ALARM REPORT command may be included in this group.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
