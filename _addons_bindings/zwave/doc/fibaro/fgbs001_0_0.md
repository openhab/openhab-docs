information in “singlecast” mode to devices assigned to the  
association group of this channel is deactivated.

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | IN1 and IN2 Broadcast inactive |

| 1 | Scenes enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Scenes disabled).

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGBS001 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Input 1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Input 2


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Controller Updates

Reports on the condition of the device
This group supports 1 nodes.
