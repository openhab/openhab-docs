The FGBS001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Universal Binary Sensor is a wireless module that makes it possible to improve the functionality of any sensor with a binary output by allowing it to communicate with Z-WAVE.  
The module allows for wireless communication between the system and the DS18B20 temperature sensors. The device can service up to two binary sensors and up to four DS18B20 temperature sensors.

### Inclusion Information

The Fibaro Sensor is added to the network by quickly pressing the B button three times (the button is located in the center of the device).

**Note:** Every time when any changes are made to the configuration of TP and TD lines (1-wire), e.g. when DS18B20 sensor(s) is (are) included/excluded, it is necessary to execute the procedure of exclusion and repeated inclusion of the sensor module to the central hub. It should be remembered that the system shall enter into the programming mode only once all the connected sensors have been detected (about 10 s).

### Exclusion Information

The Fibaro Sensor is removed from the network by quickly pressing the B button three times (the button is located in the center of the device).

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGBS001 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Input 1


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Input 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Controller Updates

Reports on the condition of the device

Association group 3 supports 1 node.
