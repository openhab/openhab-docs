The FGK101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGK101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Fibaro Door / Window Sensor is a wireless, battery powered, Z-Wave compatible reed sensor. Each time its two parts, i.e. the sensor's body and a magnet separate, a radio signal is sent. In addition the Fibaro Door / Window Sensor supports one DS18B20 temperature sensor and has one potential free input. The Fibaro Door / Window Sensor is designed for use with scenes in home automation systems and everywhere else where information related to opening / closing of doors, windows, garage gates, etc. is needed.

### Inclusion Information

**Prepare the sensor:**

1. Open the sensor with a small screwdriver (be careful)
2. Remove the paper between the battery an the contact to activate the sensor.
3. Close the sensor (be sure that it is closed correctly. The sensor must not act like a button if you push the casing. This sometimes happens. It is important to close the device correctly.)

**Include the sensor in the network:**

1. Start HABmin.
2. Navigate to Configuration > Bindings > select the ZWAVE Binding > select the devices tab on the right
3. You should see at least your ZWAVE-Controller in the list of devices.
4. Hit "include" to start the 30 sec include mode
5. Hit the button on the back of the sensor 3 times in a short row.
6. The device starts to blink in blue. If it stops repeat step 5 until the 30 sec inclusion is over. Keep the sensor not to close and not too far from the controller (between 30 cm and 100 cm)
7. Hit "reload properties" in HABmin.
8. The new device should appear in the list (grey with no name)
9. If not, hit reload in your browser and navigate back to the device list.
10. The new device should appear in the list (grey with no name)
11. If not, restart your openHAB server, hit reload in your browser and navigate back to the device list.
12. The new device should appear in the list (grey with no name)
13. If not, repeat from step 4 until the device appears (This should happen rarely. I once needed two tries. Iadded 10 devices all together.)
14. Hit the button on the back of the sensor 3 times in a short row.
15. The device starts to blink in blue. Keep the sensor not to close and not too far from the controller (between 30 cm and 100 cm)
16. Hit "reload properties" in HABmin.
17. Repeat steps 14 - 16 several times. The device in the list will first show up a name, then turn to yellow and then to green.
18. Congratulations, you fully added the sensor and it should work correctly now.

### Exclusion Information

**Exclude the sensor from the network:**

1. Start exclude mode on the ZWAVE Controller.
2. Hit the button on the back of the sensor 3 times in a short row.

### Wakeup Information

The FGK101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

The default wake-up interval will drain the battery in a few weeks to months. It's advised to set a minimum wake-up interval of 3 hours to 24 hours after the device is configured correctly and a node.xml file has been created for the device.

Default value: 8 \[0,5o C\]

Available parameter settings: 0 – 255 \[0o C to 16o C\] \[32o F – 60,8o F\] To set an appropriate parameter value use the following formula: x = delta T x 16 - for Celsius x = delta T x 80 / 9 - for Fahrenheit x = parameter value delta T – maximum acceptable temperature gradient in Celsius or Fahrenheit If the value is set to 0: - if the wake-up interval is set to 255 seconds, temperature report will be sent according to the interval, - if the wake-up interval is set to over 255, temperature report will be sent each ca. 4 minutes. Parameter size: 1 \[byte\].
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

### Parameter 13: Transmitting the alarm or control frame broadcast

Enabling/Disabling broadcast alarm for IN and TMP
Sending an alarm or control frame (for IN input, depending on parameter no.5 value), and TMP button alarm frame. The frame is sent in “broadcast” mode, i.e. to all devices within range - information sent in this mode is not repeated by the mesh network.

Default value: 0

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 14: Scene activation

Enable/Disable scene functionality
Scene activation functionality.

Default value: 0

Available parameter settings:

0 - functionality deactivated

1 - functionality activated The device offers the possibility of sending commands compatible with Command class scene activation. Information is sent to devices assigned to association group no. 3 Controllers such as the Home Center 2 are able to interpret such commands and based on these commands activate scenes, to which specific scene IDs have been assigned. The user may expand the functionality of a button connected to IN input by distinguishing the sequence of it being pushed. For example: double click would trigger the “goodnight” scene and triple click would trigger the “morning” scene. To fully use the possibilities offered by the parameter no.14 it is recommended to use a momentary or a toggle switch (parameter no.3). Scene ID is determined in the following manner: IN input: Switch from “off” to “on” ID10 Switch from “on” to “off” ID11 Remaining IDs are recognized correctly if the value of parameter no.3 was set to 2 Holding down ID12 Releasing ID13 Double click ID14 Triple click ID15 Parameter size: 1 \[byte\].
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGK101 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Input IN1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: TMP Button


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Condition


This group supports 1 nodes.
