The FGGC001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGGC001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

FIBARO Swipe is a revolutionary battery gesture control pad that allows you to control devices in your Z-Wave network without actually touching anything. Swipe up, down, left, right, make a circular gesture and use sequences to get full and intuitive control of your home.

### Inclusion Information

1. Place the Swipe within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.  
2. Set the main controller in (security/non-security) add mode (see the controller’s manual).  
3. Move and hold your hand close to the center of the pad.  
4. If the device is battery powered, high pitched beep will signal exiting the Standby Mode.  
5. Loud sound sequence will confrm entering the menu, keep holding your hand.  
6. After hearing two short beeps (green indicator colour), withdraw the hand and perform swiping up gesture to confrm selection (two beeps will confrm validity).  
7. Wait for the adding process to end.  
8. Successful adding will be confrmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and 3 short beeps (green visual indicator colour).

### Exclusion Information

1. Place the Swipe within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.  
2. Set the main controller in remove mode (see the controller’s manual).  
3. Move and hold your hand close to the center of the pad.  
4. If the device is battery powered, high pitched beep will signal exiting the Standby Mode.  
5. Loud sound sequence will confrm entering the menu, keep holding your hand.  
6. After hearing two short beeps (green indicator colour), withdraw the hand and perform swiping up gesture to confrm selection (two beeps will confrm validity).  
7. Wait for the removing process to end.  
8. Successful removing will be confrmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and sequence of 2 short beeps, pause, 1 short beep (red visual indicator colour).

### Wakeup Information

The FGGC001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Use 1st menu position to wake up the device or click the button on the back of the device once.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the FGGC001 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_36_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGGC001 supports 6 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
 Reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Flick up gesture

Association ensures direct transfer of control commands between devices, is performed without participation of the main controller and requires associated device to be in the direct range.

The Swipe in 2nd to 6th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group, with the exception of “LifeLine” that is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned.

It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.

By default 2nd-5th association groups are set to toggle mode -  single gesture will reverse state of the association group (turns ON when it’s OFF, turns OFF when it’s ON). Can be modified via  parameter 12.

States of the association groups are affected only by assigned gestures. Changing state of associated device by other means will not update remembered state of association group.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Flick down gesture

Association ensures direct transfer of control commands between devices, is performed without participation of the main controller and requires associated device to be in the direct range.

The Swipe in 2nd to 6th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group, with the exception of “LifeLine” that is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned.

It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.

By default 2nd-5th association groups are set to toggle mode -  single gesture will reverse state of the association group (turns ON when it’s OFF, turns OFF when it’s ON). Can be modified via  parameter 12.

States of the association groups are affected only by assigned gestures. Changing state of associated device by other means will not update remembered state of association group.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Flick left gesture

Association ensures direct transfer of control commands between devices, is performed without participation of the main controller and requires associated device to be in the direct range.

The Swipe in 2nd to 6th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group, with the exception of “LifeLine” that is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned.

It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.

By default 2nd-5th association groups are set to toggle mode -  single gesture will reverse state of the association group (turns ON when it’s OFF, turns OFF when it’s ON). Can be modified via  parameter 12.

States of the association groups are affected only by assigned gestures. Changing state of associated device by other means will not update remembered state of association group.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Flick right gesture

Association ensures direct transfer of control commands between devices, is performed without participation of the main controller and requires associated device to be in the direct range.

The Swipe in 2nd to 6th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group, with the exception of “LifeLine” that is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned.

It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.

By default 2nd-5th association groups are set to toggle mode -  single gesture will reverse state of the association group (turns ON when it’s OFF, turns OFF when it’s ON). Can be modified via  parameter 12.

States of the association groups are affected only by assigned gestures. Changing state of associated device by other means will not update remembered state of association group.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Circular Airwheel

Association ensures direct transfer of control commands between devices, is performed without participation of the main controller and requires associated device to be in the direct range.

The Swipe in 2nd to 6th group allows to control 5 regular or multichannel devices per an association group, with the exception of “LifeLine” that is reserved solely for the controller and hence only 1 node can be assigned.

It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. In extreme cases, system response may be delayed.

By default 2nd-5th association groups are set to toggle mode -  single gesture will reverse state of the association group (turns ON when it’s OFF, turns OFF when it’s ON). Can be modified via  parameter 12.

States of the association groups are affected only by assigned gestures. Changing state of associated device by other means will not update remembered state of association group.

Association group 6 supports 5 nodes.
