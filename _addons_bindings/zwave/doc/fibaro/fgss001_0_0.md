The FGSS001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGSS001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Fibaro Smoke Sensor is a universal, optical Z-Wave smoke sensor. The device can be hard wired (12 or 24 VDC) or battery operated (battery life 3 years*). Smoke detection is signaled through siren and LED diode blinking. Additionally, the smoke sensor signal can be sent to an alarm system or fire alarm system hub, through a NC (normally closed) contact terminals. 

The optical sensor detects smoke at an early stage of fire, often before flames appear and temperature starts to rise significantly. Moreover the device has a built-in temperature sensor, which can also trigger the alarm once the specified temperatute threshold is exceeded. 

The Fibaro Smoke Sensor is designed to be placed on a wall or ceiling. LED indicator signals fire, operating mode and used to see if device is within the Z-Wave network. The smoke sensor is designed to operate in confined spaces, under normal conditions (lacking smoke, dust, condensed water vapor)

### Inclusion Information

Manual Fibaro Smoke Sensor inclusion:

  1. Connect the power source to the Fibaro Smoke Detctor and/or install the battery. Make sure the device is located within direct range of the Z-Wave controller.
  2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
  3. Quickly, triple click the B-button, located on Fibaro Smoke Sensor’s enclosure.
  4. Fibaro Smoke Sensor will be detected and included in the Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Make sure the sensor is connected to power source (battery and/or hard wired).
  2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controller’s operating manual)
  3. Quickly, triple click the B-button, located on Fibaro Smoke Sensor’s enclosure

### Wakeup Information

The FGSS001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


If the sensor is already included in the Z-Wave network, wake it up by triple clicking the B-button..

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGSS001 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Fire Status


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: TMP Button


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Device Status


Association group 3 supports 1 node.
