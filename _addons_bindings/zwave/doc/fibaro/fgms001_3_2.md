# FGMS001 Motion Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *FGMS001*, manufactured by *[Fibargroup](http://www.fibaro.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```fibaro_fgms001_03_002```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions above 3.2

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The FGMS001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGMS001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

FIBARO Motion Sensor is a universal Z-Wave multi-sensor. Along with detecting motion the device measures the temperature and light intensity. The sensor has a built-in accelerometer to detect any tampering of the device. FIBARO Motion Sensor is battery powered device and designed to be installed quickly and easily on any surface.

The LED indicator signals motion, temperature level, operating mode and can be used to see if device is within the Z-Wave network. The motion sensor can be used for lighting scenes and presence monitoring systems.

### Wakeup Information

The FGMS001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```28```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_87_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 89: LED - tamper alarm

Indicating mode resembles a police car (white, red and blue

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED does not indicate tamper alarm. |
| 1 | LED indicates tamper alarm. |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED indicates tamper alarm.).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_89_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGMS001 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device status
"Lifeline" is a reporting group, assigned to the device status. Main Z-Wave+ network controller should be added to this group. The "Lifeline" group can handle only one device. If Fibaro Motion Sensor operates in protected mode, outgoing messages are always encrypted.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Motion

"Motion" is assigned to the motion sensor. At the moment of motion detection or alarm state cancellation, nodes added to this group will receive control frames. The "Motion" group can handle up to five devices (one or multi-channel). If Fibaro Motion Sensor operates in protected mode, outgoing messages are encrypted, depending on whether the added node also operates in secure mode.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Tamper

"Tamper" is assigned to the tamper alarm. Once tampering is detected or cancelled, nodes added to this group will receive alarm frames. The "Tamper" group can handle up to five devices (one or multi-channel). If Fibaro Motion Sensor operates in protected mode, outgoing messages are always encrypted.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Motion BC

Motion BC (backward compatibility)
"Motion BC" is assigned to the motion sensor. Once motion is detected or alarm state cancelled, nodes added to this group will receive report frames. This group aims to provide backward compatibility with controllers not supporting the Z-Wave+ protocol. Only a main controller not supporting the Z-wave+ protocol should be added to this group. The "Motion BC" group can handle up to five devices (one or multi-channel). If Fibaro Motion Sensor operates in protected mode, outgoing messages are always encrypted.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Tamper BC

Tamper BC (backward compability)
"Tamper BC" is assigned to the tamper alarm. Once tampering is detected or cancelled, nodes added to this group will receive alarm frames. This group aims to provide backward compatibility with devices not supporting the Z-Wave+ protocol. Only nodes not supporting the Z-wave+ protocol should be added to this group. The "Tamper BC" group can handle up to five devices (one or multi-channel). If Fibaro Motion Sensor operates in protected mode, outgoing messages are always encrypted. The Fibaro Motion Sensor allows for controlling 5 regular and 5 multichannel devices per an association group, out of which 1 field is reserved for the Z-Wave network main controller.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
