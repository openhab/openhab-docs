## Overview

FIBARO Wall Plug is a universal, Z-Wave Plus compatible, remotely controlled outlet adapter. This device may be applied wherever you want to control electrical devices with up to 2500W load.  
  
The Wall Plug is equipped with a power and energy metering function. It uses a LED ring to visualize the current load with colour changing illumination and operating mode. This is the smallest and most attractive device of this type available in the world.  
  
The Wall Plug may be operated using the B-button located on its casing or via any Z-Wave compatible controller.

### Inclusion Information

To add the device to the Z-Wave network:  
  
 Plug the device into a socket nearby the main Z-Wave controller.  
 The LED ring will glow red signalling not being added (reset or remove the device otherwise).  
 Set the main controller in (security/non-security) add mode (see the controller’s manual).  
 Quickly, triple click the B-button located on the casing.  
 Wait for the adding process to end.  
 Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Exclusion Information

To remove the device from the Z-Wave network:  
  
 Plug the device into a socket nearby the main Z-Wave controller.  
 The LED ring will glow green signalling being added (removing is not necessary otherwise).  
 Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).  
 Quickly, triple click the B-button located on the casing.  
 Wait for the removing process to end.  
 Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.
