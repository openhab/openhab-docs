The FGBS222 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Allows to enhance the functionality of wired sensors and other devices by adding Z-Wave network communication. You can connect binary sensors, analog sensors, DS18B20 temperature sensors or DHT22 humidity and temperature sensor to report their readings to the Z-Wave controller. It can also control devices by opening/closing output contacts independently of the inputs.

### Inclusion Information

To add the device to the Z-Wave network manually:

  1. Power the device.
  2. Set the main controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly, triple click button on the device housing or switch connected to IN1 or IN2.
  4. If you are adding in Security S2 Authenticated, scan the DSK QR code or input the 5-digit PIN code (label on the bottom of the box).
  5. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the adding process to end.
  6. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Exclusion Information

To remove the device from the Z-Wave network:

  1. Power the device.
  2. Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly, triple click button on the device housing or switch connected to IN1 or IN2.
  4. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the removing process to end.
  5. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

**Note:** Removing also results in resetting the device to factory defaults.

**Note: **Removing using switch connected to IN1 or IN2 works only if parameter 20 (IN1) or 21 (IN2) is set to 3 or 4 and parameter 40 (IN1) or 41 (IN2) does not allow sending scenes for triple click.

### General Usage Information

  2. GND (blue) – ground conductor
  3. SD (white)– signal conductor for DS18B20 or DHT22 sensor
  4. SP (brown) – power supply conductor for DS18B20 or DHT22 sensor (3.3V)
  5. IN2 (green) – input no.  2
  6. IN1 (yellow) – input no. 1
  7. GND (blue) – ground conductor
  8. P (red) – power supply conductor

**Inputs**

Both inputs can be independently configured as:

0 – Normally closed alarm input (Notification) (note: Voltage channels will go to 10V)

1 – Normally open alarm input (Notification) (note: Voltage channels will go to 10V)

2 – Monostable button (Central Scene) (note: Voltage channels will go to 10V)

3 – Bistable button (Central Scene) (note: Voltage channels will go to 10V)

4 – Analog input without internal pull-up (Sensor Multilevel) = Voltage channels active. 0 to 10V

5 – Analog input with internal pullup (Sensor Multilevel) = Voltage channels active. 0 to 10V

**Outputs** 

Both outputs are dry. i.e. no volt.

Maximum current applied to outputs 150mA

Maximum voltage applied to outputs 30V DC / 20V AC ±5%

  * OUT1 – output no. 1 assigned to input IN1 as a switch by default. This behaviour can be disabled using protection or reversed using parameters.
  * OUT2 – output no. 2 assigned to input IN2 as a switch by default. This behaviour can be disabled using protection or reversed using parameters.

Both can be set independently to normally open or normally closed.

**External Temperature and Humidity Sensors**

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGBS222 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: On/Off (IN1)

is assigned to IN1 input terminal (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: On/Off (IN2)

is assigned to IN2 input terminal (uses Basic command class).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
