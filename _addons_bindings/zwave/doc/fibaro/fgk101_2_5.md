The FGK101 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The FGK101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Fibaro Door / Window Sensor is a wireless, battery powered, Z-Wave compatible reed sensor. Each time its two parts, i.e. the sensor's body and a magnet separate, a radio signal is sent. In addition the Fibaro Door / Window Sensor supports one DS18B20 temperature sensor and has one potential free input. The Fibaro Door / Window Sensor is designed for use with scenes in home automation systems and everywhere else where information related to opening / closing of doors, windows, garage gates, etc. is needed.

### Inclusion Information

**To add the device to the Z-Wave network:**

1. Place the device within direct range of the Z-Wave controller.
2. Make sure that Sensor’s cover is closed.
3. Find the TMP button located on the underside of the device, which allows for proper inclusion.
4. Set the main Z-Wave controller into the learning mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
5. Quickly, triple click the TMP button.
6. Wait for the adding process to end.
7. Successful adding will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

Adding/removing will be confirmed by LED blinking. Fast blinking means that the inclusion process has not been successful.

### Exclusion Information

**To exclude the device from the Z-Wave network:**

1. Place the device within direct range of the Z-Wave controller.
2. Make sure that Sensor’s cover is closed.
3. Find the TMP button located on the underside of the device, which allows for proper inclusion.
4. Set the main Z-Wave controller into exclusion mode (see main controller’s operating manual).
5. Quickly, triple click the TMP button.
6. Wait for the exclusion process to end.
7. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message.

### Wakeup Information

The FGK101 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

**Waking up the Door/Window Sensor:**

FIBARO Door/Window Sensor needs to be woken up to receive information about the new configuration from the controller, like parameters and associations.

To wake up the sensor manually triple click the TMP button located underside the casing.

### Parameter 14: Scene activation

Enable/Disable scene functionality
The device offers the possibility of sending commands compatible with Command class scene activation. Information is sent to devices assigned to association group no. 3

Available settings:  
0 – functionality deactivated  
**1** – functionality activated  
Default setting: 0

Controllers such as the Home Center 2 are able to interpret such commands and based on these commands activate scenes, to which specific scene IDs have been assigned. The user may expand the functionality of a button connected to IN input by distinguishing the sequence of it being pushed. For example: double click would trigger the “goodnight” scene and triple click would trigger the “morning” scene. To fully use the possibilities offered by the parameter no.14 it is recommended to use a momentary or a toggle switch (parameter no.3).

Scene ID is determined in the following manner:  
IN input:  
Switch from “off” to “on” ID10  
Switch from “on” to “off” ID11  
Remaining IDs are recognized correctly if the value of parameter no.3 was set to 2  
Holding down ID12  
Releasing ID13  
Double click ID14  
Triple click ID15
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: DS18B20

Status of DS18B20 sensor
The parameter value is automatically sent to the association group III if the connected sensor DS18B20 four times mistakenly read the temperature. In case of Wake Up Interval set for 4000 seconds temperature sensor will be checked every 5 minutes.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | DS18B20 is working properly |
| 1 | DS18B20 is not working properly |
| 255 | No DS18B20 temperature sensor |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (DS18B20 is working properly).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGK101 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Input IN1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: TMP Button


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Condition


This group supports 1 nodes.
