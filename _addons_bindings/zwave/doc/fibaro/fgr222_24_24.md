The FGR222 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The device allows for controlling motors of roller blinds, awnings, venetian blinds, gates and others, which are single phase AC powered.

### Inclusion Information

Fibaro Roller Shutter may be included into the Z-Wave network via the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal. In addition, the module may be included in auto inclusion mode, by simply connecting the power supply.

Automatic Z-Wave network inclusion:

1. Make sure the power supply is disconnected and a Roller Shutter is located within a direct Z-Wave network’s main controller communication range.
2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
3. Connect the power supply to include the Roller Shutter in auto inclusion mode. 4) Fibaro Roller Shutter will be automatically detected and included into the Z-Wave network.

To disable the auto inclusion mode, press the B-button briefly, after connecting the module to the power supply.

Manual Z-Wave network inclusion:

1. Connect the power supply.
2. Set the main controller into the learn mode (see main controllers operating manual).
3. Triple click the B-button or a push button connected to the S1 terminal.
4. Fibaro Roller Shutter will be detected and included into the Z-Wave network.

### Exclusion Information
