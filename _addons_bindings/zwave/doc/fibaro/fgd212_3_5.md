## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGD212 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the devi


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the devi


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the devi


This group supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the devi


This group supports 10 nodes.
