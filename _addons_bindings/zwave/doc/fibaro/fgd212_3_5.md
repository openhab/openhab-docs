The FGD212 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Remotely controlled light dimming module is designed to work with various types of light sources. It may be connected to two-wire or three-wire configuration so it can operate with or without neutral lead. FIBARO Dimmer 2 can switch or dim connected light source either through radio waves or through the wall switch connected directly to it.

New FIBARO Dimmer 2 is equipped with an algorithm of smart light source detection which makes configuration easier and ensures high compatibility of the device. It may be used as a switch with nondimmable light sources (in 3-wire connection).

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGD212 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

Sends BASIC SET command class
Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the device

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Sends BASIC SET command class
Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the device

Association group 3 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Sends BASIC SET command class
Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the device

Association group 4 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 5: Group 5

Sends BASIC SET command class
Sends BASIC SET command class frame according to the state of the device

Association group 5 supports 10 nodes.
