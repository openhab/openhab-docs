The FGRGBW supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Fibaro RGBW Controller is a universal, Z-Wave compatible RGB / RGBW controller. Fibaro RGBW Controller uses PWM output signal, which enables it to control LED, RGB, RGBW strips, halogen lights and fans. Controlled devices may be powered by 12 or 24 VDC. In addition the device supports up to four, 0V - 10V analog sensors, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, wind sensors, air quality sensors, light sensors etc. All IN and OUT terminals may be user configured for LED control or 0V-10V signal readouts.

### Inclusion Information

Triple click the B-button or any switch connected to I1-I4 inputs

### Exclusion Information

Triple click the B-button or any switch connected to I1-I4 inputs

### General Usage Information

**Warning!  
  
** 

  1. Fibaro RGBW Controller is dedicated to operate in low voltage circuits of 12VDC or 24VDC. Connecting higher voltage load may result in Fibaro RGBW Controller damage.
  2. Fibaro RGBW Controller must be powered by the same voltage as the connected light source. I.e. if controlling 12V LED strip, the module must be connected to 12V power supply. Similarly, if controlling 24V RGBW strip, Fibaro RGBW Controller must be powered by 24V voltage supply.
  3. Fibaro RGBW Controller has 0-10V input. There is no 0-10V output. Output is controlled by PWM at 244Hz.
  4. Fibaro RGBW Controller must be powered by 12VDC or 24 VDC stabilized power supply with outputs load capacity matched to loads voltage.
  5. Sensors using 0-10V interface use wire connection to inputs I1 - I4. Maximum length of 0-10V connection line is 10 m. Observe sensor's manufacturer recommendations towards 0-10V line diameter.
  6. In case of connecting long RGBW/RGB/LED strips voltage drops may occur, resulting in lower light brightness further from R/G/B/W outputs. To eliminate this effect it's recommended to connect few shorter strips in serial connection instead of one long strip connected parallel. Maximum recommended wire length, used to connect R/G/B/W outputs with a RGBW/RGB/LED strip is 10 m. Observe connected loads manufacturer recommendations towards connection wire diameter.
