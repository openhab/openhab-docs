The FGWDS supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

FIBARO Walli Single Switch is a smart wall switch designed to control one light sources via Z-Wave network. It measures active power and energy consumed by the controlled load. You can install it with provided cover plate or other compatible.   
Main features of FIBARO Walli Single Switch: 

  *  Can be used with:  
      * Conventional incandescent and halogen light sources, 
      *  LED lamps, 
      * Fluorescent lamps, 
      * Electronic transformers (for ELV halogen lamps and LED bulbs), 
      * Ferromagnetic transformers (for MLV halogen lamps). 
  * Can be used with provided cover plate or one of the following:  
      * GIRA – System 55 (Standard 55, E2, Event, Event Clear), 
      * Legrand – Céliane, 
      * Schneider – Odace. 
  * Active power and energy consumption metering. 
  * Supports Z-Wave network Security Modes: S0 with AES-128 encryption and S2 Authenticated with PRNG-based encryption. 
  * Works as Z-Wave signal repeater (all non-battery operated devices within the network will act as repeaters to increase reliability of the network). 
  * May be used with all devices certified with the Z-Wave Plus certificate and should be compatible with such devices produced by other manufacturers. 

### Inclusion Information

# To add the device to the Z-Wave network manually:

  1. Power the device.
  2. Set the main controller in (Security/non-Security Mode) add mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly, three times click one of the buttons.
  4. If you are adding in Security S2 Authenticated, scan the DSK QR code or input the underlined part of the DSK (label on the bottom of the box).
  5. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the adding process to end.

Adding result will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and the LED frame:

  * Green - successful (non-secure, S0, S2 non-authenticated),
  * Magenta - successful (Security S2 Authenticated),
  * Red – not successful.

# To add the device to the Z-Wave network using SmartStart:

  1. Set the main controller in Security S2 Authenticated add mode (see the controller’s manual). 
  2. Scan the DSK QR code or input the underlined part of the DSK (label on the bottom of the box).
  3. Power the device.
  4. Wait for the adding process to start (up to few minutes), which is signaled with yellow LED blinking.

Adding result will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and the LED frame:

  *  Green - successful (non-secure, S0, S2 non-authenticated),
  * Magenta - successful (Security S2 Authenticated),
  * Red – not successful.

### Exclusion Information

To remove the device from the Z-Wave network:

  1. Power the device.
  2. Set the main controller into remove mode (see the controller’s manual).
  3. Quickly, three times click one of the buttons.
  4. LED will start blinking yellow, wait for the removing process to end.
  5. Successful removing will be confirmed by the Z-Wave controller’s message and red LED colour.

### General Usage Information

# Factory reset:

Reset procedure allows to restore the device back to its factory settings, which means all information about the Z-Wave controller and user configuration will be deleted. Resetting to factory defaults does not reset energy consumption memory.

  1. Quickly, three times click, then press and hold one of the buttons to enter the menu.
  2. Release the button when the device glows yellow.
  3. Quickly click the button to confirm.
  4. After a few seconds the device will be restarted, which is signalled with the red LED colour.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The FGWDS supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
“Lifeline” reports the device status
1st association group – “Lifeline” reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only (main controller by default).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: 1st channel On/Off 

(uses Basic command class).
2nd association group – “On/Off (1)” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting button operation for 1st channel (uses Basic command class).

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: 1st channel dimmer

(uses Switch Multilevel command class).
3rd association group – “Dimmer (1)” is used to change level of associated devices reflecting button operation for 1st channel (uses Switch Multilevel command class).

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: 2nd channel On/Off

(uses Basic command class).
4th association group* – “On/Off (2)” is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting button operation for 2nd channel (uses Basic command class).

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: 2nd channel dimmer

(uses Switch Multilevel command class).
5th association group* – “Dimmer (2)” is used to change level of associated devices reflecting button operation for 2nd channel (uses Switch Multilevel command class).

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
