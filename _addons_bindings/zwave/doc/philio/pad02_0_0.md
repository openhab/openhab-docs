The PAD02 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

PAD02 is an E27(EU)/ E26(US) Edison screw based lamp socket, which provides electrical connection to the E14(EU)/ E12(US) Edison screw based lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of socket allows lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced. You can On/Off the light by pressing the button briefly, or a long pressing to control the brightness of dimmable lightbulb. This dimmer is a transceiver which is a security enabled device which based on Z-Wave Plus technology, and it is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Since PAD02 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device.

**LED Indication**

To distinguish what mode the switch is in, view from the LED for identification.

Normal - Whenever we switch On and off of the PAD02 by On/Off button or RF command, the LED will lights up when switch on; whereas LED off when switch off.

No node ID - Under normal operation, when the Switch has not been allocated a node ID, the LED flashes on and off alternately at 2-second intervals. By pressing On/Off button, it will stop flashing temporarily.

Learning - When PAD02 is in learning mode, LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals.

### Inclusion Information

In the front casing, there is an on/off button with LED indicator below which is used to switch on and off or carries out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association. When first power applied, its LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals. It implies that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion.

**Auto Inclusion**

The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the dimmer does not have Node ID and just connect the switch to main power. Note: Auto inclusion timeout is 2 minute during which the node information of explorer frame will be emitted once every several seconds. Unlike “inclusion” function as shown in the table below, the execution of auto inclusion is free from pressing the On/Off button on the dimmer.

**Inclusion procedure**

1\. Put your Z-Wave controller into inclusion mode by following the instructions provided by the controller manufacturer.

2\. Pressing Include button of PAD02 three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

Note: One press one flash LED

### Exclusion Information

1\. Put your Z-Wave controller into exclusion mode by following the instructions provided by the controller manufacturer.

2\. Pressing Include button of PAD02 three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

Note: One press one flash LED.

Result: Node ID has been excluded. 0.5s On, 0.5s Off (Enter auto inclusion).

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PAD02 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the PAD02.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Mode of  Switch Off  function | Switch button mode (enabled/disabled). |
| 2 | LED indication mode | LED mode: 1 is show switch state. 2 is night mode (opposite). |
| 3 | Auto off timer | Automatic OFF after given time. |
| 4 | RF off command mode | How to interpret OFF command. |

### Parameter 1: Mode of  Switch Off  function

Switch button mode (enabled/disabled).
When the mode of switch On/Off is set to 0, any command of switch off will be disabled and the On/Off function of include button will be disabled.

The default setting is enable mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: LED indication mode

LED mode: 1 is show switch state. 2 is night mode (opposite).
LED indication mode :

1 Show Switch State:When switch is on, LED is on. When switch is off, LED is off. This is default setting.

2 Show Night mode:When switch is on, LED is off. When switch is off, LED is on.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Show current switch state |
| 2 | Night mode (opposite) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Show current switch state).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Auto off timer

Automatic OFF after given time.
Whenever DEVICE switches to on, the auto off timer begin to count down. After the timer decrease to zero, it will switch to off automatically. However if Auto off timer is set as 0, the auto off function will be disabled. The default setting is 0 (function disabled).
Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: RF off command mode

How to interpret OFF command.
Whenever a switch off command, BASIC\_SET 、BINARY\_SWITCH\_SET 、SWITCH\_ALL\_OFF, is received, it could be interpreted as 4 variety of commands:

0: Switch Off:It switches to OFF state. This is default setting.

1: Ignore:The switch off command will be ignored.

The PAD02 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1

Where to send ALARM\_REPORT and DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY\_NOTIFICATION
This group supports 1 nodes.
