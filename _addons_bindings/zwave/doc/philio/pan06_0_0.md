# PAN06 In Wall Dual Relay (1 Way) Switch Module 2 x 1.5kW
This describes the Z-Wave device *PAN06*, manufactured by *[Philio Technology Corp](http://www.philio-tech.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```philio_pan06_00_000```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware versions below 1.7

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The PAN06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The PAN06 allows controlling two independent loads both wirelessly via Z-Wave and locally utilizing a traditional wall switch. Thanks to its calibration technology the device cannot only be used to switch resistive devices but also works perfectly with many kind of reactive or resistive loads such as fluorescent lights or LEDs.  
The device is placed in a wall box right behind the normal switch. The switch is not longer directly  
connected to the load but acts as input device for the insert that is controlling the load. This device is  
designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.

### Inclusion Information

1. Have Z-Wave Controller entered inclusion mode  
2. Pressing Include button of PAN06 three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

1. Have Z-Wave Controller entered exclusion mode  
2. Pressing Include button of PAN06 three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PAN06 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Switch 1 | switch_binary1 | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Switch 2 | switch_binary2 | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Switch 3 | switch_binary3 | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Alarm
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Switch 1
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary1``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 2
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary2``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 3
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary3``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the PAN06.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Selected endpoint | Send Basic Command Class |
| 2 | Switch mode | Change the external switch mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Selected endpoint

Send Basic Command Class
If Controller not using Multi_Channel command class to access the endpoint of PAN06, you may configure the endpoint value to react the Basic Command Class
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Relay 1 + 2 |
| 2 | Relay 1 |
| 3 | Relay 2 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Relay 1 + 2).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Switch mode

Change the external switch mode

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge mode |
| 2 | Pulse mode |
| 3 | Edge-Toggle mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Edge mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PAN06 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Relay 1


Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Relay 2


Association group 3 supports 1 node.
