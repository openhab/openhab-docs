## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the PAN06.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Selected endpoint |  |
| 2 | Switch mode | Change the external switch mode |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Selected endpoint


If Controller not using Multi\_Channel command class to access the endpoint of PAN06, you may configure the endpoint value to react the Basic Command Class
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Relay 1 + 2 |
| 2 | Relay 1 |
| 3 | Relay 2 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Relay 1 + 2).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Switch mode

Change the external switch mode

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Edge mode |
| 2 | Pulse mode |
| 3 | Edge-Toggle mode |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Edge mode).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PAN06 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Relay 1 + 2


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Relay 1


This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 3: Relay 2


This group supports 1 nodes.
