# ZIP-PAB01 Zipato Micromodule Energy Meter

The ZIP-PAB01 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZIP-PAB01.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Power meter report period | Power meter report period, in 5 seconds unit. 720 -> 1 hour |
| 2 | Energy meter report period | The accumulated power consumption report period |
| 3 | Selected default endpoint | 1 => CT1 and CT2, 2 => CT1, 3 => CT2 |

### Parameter 1: Power meter report period

Power meter report period, in 5 seconds unit. 720 -> 1 hour
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value 720), the module will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to the node of the corresponding group. The maximum interval to report its instant power consumption is 45h (5s \* 32767 / 3600 = 45h)
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Energy meter report period

The accumulated power consumption report period
If the setting is configured for 1 hour (set value 720), the module will report its accumulated power consumption every 1 hour to the node of the corresponding group. The maximum interval to report its accumulated power consumption is 45h (5s \* 32767 / 3600 = 45h)
Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Selected default endpoint

1 => CT1 and CT2, 2 => CT1, 3 => CT2
If Controller does not use Multi Channel command class to access the endpoint of the module, you may configure the endpoint that will react to the Basic Command Class, Binary Switch command class or Meter command class V3.
Values in the range 1 to 3 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZIP-PAB01 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: CT1 and CT2

Sum of CT1 and CT2
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: CT1

Data from CT1
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 3: CT2

Data from CT2
This group supports 1 nodes.
