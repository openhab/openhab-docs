# PST02C Slim Multi-Sensor (Door/Temperature/Illumination)
This describes the Z-Wave device *PST02C*, manufactured by *[Philio Technology Corp](http://www.philio-tech.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```philio_pst02c_00_000```.

The PST02C supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PST02C does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

The slim multisensor PST02 has PIR, door/window, temperature and illumination, 4 sensors function in one, based on Z-WaveTM technology. It is the Z-WaveTM plus product, it support the security, OTA... Those newest features of the Z-WaveTM technology. Z-WaveTM is a wireless communication protocol designed for home automation, specifically to remotely control applications in residential and light commercial environments. The technology uses a low-power RF radio embedded or retrofitted into home electronics devices and systems, such as lighting, home access control, entertainment systems and household appliances.

This product can be included and operated in any Z-WaveTM network with other Z-WaveTM certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.

The device adopt the Z-WaveTM 500 series chip, when your Z-WaveTM network system is all made by Z-WaveTM 500 series devices. The network system will have the advantages as below.

### Inclusion Information

There are two tamper keys in the device, one is in the back side, another is in the front side. Both of them can add, remove, reset or association from Z-WaveTM network.

In the first time, add the device into the Z-WaveTM network. First, make sure the primary controller is in the add mode. And then power on the device, just take out the insulation Mylar in the back side of the device. The device will auto start the NWI (Network Wide Inclusion) mode. And it should be included in 5 seconds. You will see the LED light ON one second.

1. Have Z-WaveTM Controller entered inclusion mode.
2. Pressing tamper key three times within 1.5 seconds to enter the inclusion mode.
3. After add successful, the device will wake to receive the setting command from Z-WaveTM Controller about 20 seconds.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PST02C supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Reports


This group supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Light Control


This group supports 8 nodes.
