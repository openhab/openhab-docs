The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 4 configuration parameters available in the PAN08.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt meter report interval (5s) | Interval (x5 seconds) to send out watt meter report |
| 2 | KWH Meter Report Interval (10min) | Interval (x10 minutes) to send out KWH Meter Report |
| 3 | Threshold for Load Caution (10mA) | Threshold (x0.01A) of current for Load Caution |
| 4 | Threshold of KWh for Load Caution |  |

### Parameter 1: Watt meter report interval (5s)

Interval (x5 seconds) to send out watt meter report

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```720```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: KWH Meter Report Interval (10min)

Interval (x10 minutes) to send out KWH Meter Report

Values in the range 1 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Threshold for Load Caution (10mA)

Threshold (x0.01A) of current for Load Caution

Values in the range 1 to 1100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Threshold of KWh for Load Caution



Values in the range 1 to 10000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PAN08 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Blind Control


This group supports 1 nodes.
