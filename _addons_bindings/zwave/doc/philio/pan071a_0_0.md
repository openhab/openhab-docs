The Philio PAN07-1A supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This in-wall switch module is able to detect Instant power wattage and overload current (6A) of connected light or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Module will be disabled and its On/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly. However, disconnect and re-connect the Module will reset its overload condition to normal status.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Philio PAN07-1A supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

For group 1, the Switch will report (1) ON/OFF status of Relay1 and Relay2 (2) Instant Power Consumption (Watt) of Relay1 and Relay2 (3) Accumulated Power Consumption (KWh) of Relay1 and Relay2 to Z-Wave Controller.  

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

For group 2, the Switch will report (1) ON/OFF status of Relay1 (2) Instant Power Consumption (Watt) of Relay1 (3) Accumulated Power Consumption (KWh) of Relay1 to Z-Wave Controller. 

Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Group 3

For group 3, the Switch will report (1) ON/OFF status of Relay2 (2) Instant Power Consumption (Watt) of Relay2 (3) Accumulated Power Consumption (KWh) of Relay2 to Z-Wave Controller. 

Association group 3 supports 1 node.
