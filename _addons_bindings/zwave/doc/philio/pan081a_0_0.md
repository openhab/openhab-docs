# PAN08-1a Roller shutter controller
This describes the Z-Wave device *PAN08-1a*, manufactured by *[Philio Technology Corp](http://www.philio-tech.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```philio_pan081a_00_000```.

The PAN08-1a supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is designed to switch rise/lower roller shutter  
connected to its terminals using radio waves, controllers and a push button directly  
connected to this Roller Controller.  
This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave PlusTM  
enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Slim  
design let the Controller can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good  
for the house decoration.  
The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by  
the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of Roller Shutter.  
This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is able to detect position of the Shutter by using  
the patterned power measuring method, so it can be remote controlled not only fully  
up or down , but also can be adjusted to ex. 30% or 50%. And when manual  
controlled by push button, the controller also can memorize the position and send the  
new shutter position to its controller (ex. IP-Gateway).

### Inclusion Information

In the front casing, there is an include button with LED indicator below which is used  
to carry out inclusion, exclusion, reset or association. When first power is applied, its  
LED flashes on and off alternately and repeatedly at 0.5 second intervals. It implies  
that it has not been assigned a node ID and start auto inclusion.

The function of auto inclusion will be executed as long as the PAN08 does not have  
Node ID and just connect the PAN08 to main power.

Note: Auto inclusion timeout is 2 minute during which the node information of  
explorer frame will be emitted once every several seconds.

### Exclusion Information

 Put your Z-Wave controller into  
exclusion mode by following the  
instructions provided by the  
controller manufacturer.

 Pressing Include button three times  
within 2 seconds will enter exclusion  
mode.

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Dimmer

The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |
