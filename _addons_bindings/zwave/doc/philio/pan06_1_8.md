The PAN06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The PAN06 allows controlling two independent loads both wirelessly via Z-Wave and locally utilizing a traditional wall switch. Thanks to its calibration technology the device cannot only be used to switch resistive devices but also works perfectly with many kind of reactive or resistive loads such as fluorescent lights or LEDs.  
The device is placed in a wall box right behind the normal switch. The switch is not longer directly  
connected to the load but acts as input device for the insert that is controlling the load. This device is  
designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.

### Inclusion Information

1\. Have Z-Wave Controller entered inclusion mode.  
2\. Pressing Include button of PAN06 three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode

### Exclusion Information

1\. Have Z-Wave Controller entered exclusion mode.  
2\. Pressing Include button of PAN06 three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PAN06 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |
| Switch 1 | switch_binary1 | Switch | Switch | 
| Switch 2 | switch_binary2 | Switch | Switch | 
| Switch 3 | switch_binary3 | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Switch 1

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary1``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 2

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary2``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Switch 3

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary3``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.
