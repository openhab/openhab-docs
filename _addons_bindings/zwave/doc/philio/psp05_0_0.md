The PSP05 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PSP05 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The PSP05 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PSP05 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (burglar) | alarm_burglar | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Alarm (burglar)

Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.

### Parameter 3: PIR Sensitivity

Adjust the PIR Sensitivity
This setting sets the sensitivity of the PIR (motion) sensor. A setting of 0 (zero) will disable the sensor, with 99 being the highest level of sensitivity. The default sensitivity setting is 80.

The higher the sensitivity, the greater the range of detection (things farther away will trigger the sensor). However, this may also result in things that are nearer triggering the sensor too frequently.
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```80```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Motion OFF Reporting

Sends notification when motion has completed.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Don't Send Report |
| 1 | Send Report |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Don't Send Report).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1_00000010``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Notification Type

Method used to send notifications on motion
Indicates method used to send notifications in the event of motion being triggered. Either Binary Sensor or Notification
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Report Notification |
| 1 | Binary Sensor |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Report Notification).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1_00001000``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Send Multi CC in auto report

Send Multi CC in auto report
Investigation required to determine purpose of this.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable |
| 1 | Enable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1_00010000``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Send Battery Report when Triggered

Whether or not a battery status report should be sent when triggered

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Enable |
| 1 | Disable |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Enable).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1_00100000``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: Re-detection interval

Multiples of 8 seconds to wait before re-detection
By default, the sensor will wait 24 seconds (3 x 8) after detecting motion before it will send a further detection report. This value can be increased to a maximum of 127 (which is 127 \* 8), meaning the re-detection interval will be 1,016 seconds (~17 minutes). The minimum value is 1 (1 \* 8), meaning a re-detection interval of 8 seconds.

The default is a value of 3, meaning a re-detection interval of 24 seconds.
Values in the range 1 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Turn off light time

Time to wait after lighting has been turned on before turning off again
Number of seconds (in multiples of 8) to wait before turning off lights that were turned on as a result of motion occurring. A default value of 4 means (4 x 8) 32 seconds later, lights will be turned off.

This setting should only be used when you are using association groups to control lighting events. If you are controlling on/off events as a result of motion through independent rules, this setting is irrelevant.
Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```4```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Batery level reporting interval

How frequently battery status should be reported
The frequency (in multiples of 'Tick Time') that the device should send battery status reports. If set to 0, battery status reports are not sent.

The default 'tick time' (see other parameter settings) is 30, meaning 30 minutes. The default value of this parameter is 12, meaning that a battery report will be sent every 6 hours (12 \* 30 minutes).
Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```12```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 20: Tick Interval

Interval time for sending reports
This setting is used by the battery reporting interval setting. This setting defines the 'tick interval' or the number of time blocks to wait between sending reports. The default value of 30 means that a tick interval is 30 minutes.
Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_20_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSP05 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The group 1 is for receiving the report message
This group supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic Set

The group 2 is for light control
This group supports 8 nodes.
