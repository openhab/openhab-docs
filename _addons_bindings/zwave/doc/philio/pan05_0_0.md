The PAN05-1B supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This in-wall switch module is a transceiver which is a security enabled device which based on Z-Wave Plus technology, and it is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Mini size design let the module can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration. Since PAN05 supports Security Command Class, it can learn with Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device.  

### Inclusion Information

Pressing Include button of PAN05 three times within 2 seconds will enter inclusion mode

### Exclusion Information

Pressing Include button of PAN05 three times within 2 seconds will enter exclusion mode.
