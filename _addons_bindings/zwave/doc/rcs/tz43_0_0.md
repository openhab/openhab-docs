The TZ43 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The TZ43 thermostat provides for typical thermostat control of a central heating and cooling HVAC system plus has the added feature of ZWave communications for remote control.

The thermostat has a large, backlit graphical display, control buttons, status LEDs and a temperature sensor. The thermostat can display multiple screens for different functions of the thermostat. In the default thermostat control screen, shown below, it displays the current temperature, setpoint, system mode, manual fan mode, time, outside temperature and other information.  

### Inclusion Information
