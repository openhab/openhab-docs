The TBZ48 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The Z-Wave Thermostat (GC-TBZ48) is a programmable, Z-Wave communicating thermostat. It can be powered using 24VAC (if both “R”&”C”wires are available at the thermostat), or using four (4) AA batteries. Using Z-Wave technology, end users have the ability to use the 2GIG Go!Control panel to control the thermostat, configure programming settings, as well as to display current conditions in the home or office.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Press any button to take thermostat out of sleep mode.
  2. Press and hold FAN button for 5 seconds. SETUP will be displayed in the status display line.
  3. Scroll to “Z-Wave” using up & down buttons. Press SELECT.
  4. When prompted by your Z-Wave controller, Press the YES button on in the Z-Wave Install screen.
  5. Press SELECT (mode button) to add thermostat to network

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set your primary controller to Include, add or Install mode, to add the thermostat as a node on your network (see your controller’s user manual for detailed instructions).
  2. Press any button to take thermostat out of sleep mode.
  3. Press and hold FAN button for 5 seconds. SETUP will be displayed in the status display line.
  4. Scroll to “Z-Wave” using up/down buttons. Press SELECT.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the TBZ48 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Thermostat mode | thermostat_mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (cooling) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Thermostat fan mode | thermostat_fanmode | thermostat_fanmode |  |  | 
| Thermostat fan state | thermostat_fanstate | thermostat_fanstate |  |  | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat mode
Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel is of type ```thermostat_mode``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |

### Setpoint (cooling)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Setpoint (heating)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Thermostat fan mode
Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Thermostat fan state
Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TBZ48 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
