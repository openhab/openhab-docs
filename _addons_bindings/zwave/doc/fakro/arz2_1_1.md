The ARZ 1.1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The ARZ Z-Wave roller shutters are intended for mounting onto FAKRO roof windows.

### Inclusion Information

**Autoinclusion** - This feature allow you to add hard to reach devices to Z-Wave network. 3-times ON and OFF the power roller shutter (OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON) causes the introduction of roller shutter to Autoinclusion mode. Please note that the procedure has been started the time between on and off can not exceed 20s. Autoinclusion mode is activated for a maximum of 10 minutes. During this time, we can add an awning to any Z-Wave controller running in the Include procedure.

**Include** - This function allow you to add roller shutter to the network Z-Wave. Follow the procedur adding device to the network Z-Wave according to user manual supplied with the product. Then, press the programming button P on the roller shutter for 1 second.

### Exclusion Information

**Exclude** - This function allow you to remove roller shutter from the network Z-Wave. Follow the procedur removing device from the network Z-Wave according to user manual supplied with the product. Then, press the programming button P on the roller shutter for 1 second. Function removes information only about newtork Z-Wave.

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ARZ 1.1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 12 | Calibration Mode |  |
| 13 | BASIC SET Response | Allows to change motor behavior after receiving BASIC_SET with value 0xFF |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 12: Calibration Mode


This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Calibrated |
| 2 | Discalibrated |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Calibrated).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: BASIC SET Response

Allows to change motor behavior after receiving BASIC_SET with value 0xFF

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | FF go to Max |
| 2 | FF go to previous position |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (FF go to Max).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ARZ 1.1 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group for position reporting roller shutter after each a stoppage and alarm reporting (overcurrent, damage encoders).

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Repeat

Group used to transfer the received basic commands to the devices included in this group.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel Repeat

Group used to transfer the received multilevel commands to the devices included in this group.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
