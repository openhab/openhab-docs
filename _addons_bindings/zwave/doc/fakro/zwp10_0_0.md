The ZWP10 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The** ZWP10** multi-channel remote control enables radio control of FAKRO electrical accessories and of other manufacturers which are compatible with the Z-Wave communication module. The ZWP10 remote control can be used to operate up to 10 devices individually on five channels (two devices per channel). It also allows the creation of 10 independent groups. Each group can contain several devices operated simultaneously.

The controller's memory can contain up to 231 devices.

The ZWP10 remote control can serve as the basic controller (PRIMARY) and additional controller (SECONDARY). The PRIMARY controller allows to integrate numerous devices into one radio network, while the SECONDARY controller acts as additional controller in an already existing network.

In addition to Basic control mode, i.e.: ?, ⏹️, ?, the ZWP10 remote control also features Multilevel mode which allows e.g. for smooth dimming of light or smooth operation of roller shutters and blinds (by keeping the ? or ? button pressed). For convenience the ZWP10 remote can be magnetically attached to a wall mounted holder.    

### Inclusion Information

By default the ZWP10 is the primary controller. Inclusion mode is enabled by pressing once the IN/EX button at the back of the remote control. LEDs 1 and 4 will turn on. Follow the instructions on the device to be included (within 10 seconds). Upon successful inclusion, LEDs 2 & 3 will briefly turn on.

In case the ZWP10 is added to an existing network: set the primary controller in INCLUDE mode. Press three times the IN/EX button at the back of the ZWP10 remote control to be included until LEDs 1 and 3 turn on. Upon completion, LEDs 2 & 4 will briefly turn on to confirm successful inclusion as SECONDARY controller.    

### Exclusion Information

When the ZWP10 is the primary controller: press twice the IN/EX button at the back of the remote control until LEDs 1 and 3 turn on. Follow the instructions on the device to be excluded (within 10 seconds). Upon successful inclusion, LEDs 1 & 4 will briefly turn on.

**Remark:** you can exclude any included device this way, even if the ZWP10 remote controller has been reset to factory defaults.       

### Wakeup Information

The ZWP10 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


The user manual doesn't provide information about waking up the ZWP10 portable remote. However, communication with the primary controller can be initiated by pressing the SELECT button (↔️) for **at least 3 seconds** until LEDs 1, 2, 3 and 4 start blinking. Communication starts when releasing the SELECT button (↔️). LEDs 1, 2, 3 and 4 will keep blink simultaneously until the communication is finished.    

### General Usage Information

The **ZWP10** controller enables radio control of FAKRO electrical accessories and of other manufacturers that are compatible with the Z-Wave system. The ZWP10 controller operates up to 10 devices, separately on 5 channels (2 devices for 1 channel). It also allows the creation of 10 independent groups. Each group can include several devices operated simultaneously.

The ZWP10 controller's memory can contain up to 231 devices.

The ZWP10 controller is equipped with a two-way Z-Wave radio communication module exploiting radio wave frequency (frequency depending on the country for which the product is intended). It can be used as the basic controller – PRIMARY (default) as well as an additional controller – SECONDARY. The PRIMARY controller allows for integration of many devices into one radio network while the SECONDARY controller is used as an additional controller in an already existing network (see LEARN MODE function).

# 1. Operation modes

In addition to **Basic Mode** of operation (?, ⏹️, ?), the ZWP10 controller offers **Multilevel Mode** allowing for e.g. smooth dimming of light or partial opening of blinds and shutters:

  * **Basic** – press function buttons (? or ?) in order to cause the device to move and press ⏹️ in order to stop the device.

  * **Multilevel** – keep function button (? or ?) pressed until until the device reaches desired position. Operation stops when button of movement is released.

Switch between the 5 channels by pressing repeatedly the SELECT button (↔️) until the desired channel is selected. The green LEDs will indicate the selected channel:

  1. Channel 1: LED 1
  2. Channel 2: LED 2
  3. Channel 3: LED 3
  4. Channel 4: LED 4
  5. Channel 5: LEDs 1, 2, 3, 4

Each channel features 2 sets of function buttons (?, ⏹️, ?). Each set can be assigned to a device or a device group.
