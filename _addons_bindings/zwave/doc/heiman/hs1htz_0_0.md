# HS1HT-Z Temperature/Humidity Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *HS1HT-Z *, manufactured by *[Heiman Technology Co. Ltd](http://www.heimantech.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```heiman_hs1htz_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Sensor*, defining Device used to measure something.

The HS1HT-Z  supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HS1HT-Z  does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Smart Temperature and Humidity Sensor is designed to detect the temperature and humidity in house, and reports the abnormal conditions to users' mobile phone, Users could also check the real-time temperature and humidity via mobile phone, The sensor adopts Z-Wave wireless communication protocol with high sensitivity.

### Inclusion Information

Click \[Add\] icon in Z-Wave Controller.  
\- Press the Net\_Button 3 times within 1.5s, Green LED is Blinking 3 times within 1 second.  
\- If Inclusion Process is successful, Green LED will turn off.

### Exclusion Information

Click \[Remove\] icon in Z-Wave Controller.  
\- Press the Net\_Button 3 times within 1.5s   
\- If Exclusion Process is successful, Green LED is Blinking 6 times, then turn off

### Wakeup Information

The HS1HT-Z  does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HS1HT-Z  -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Sensor (relative humidity) | sensor_relhumidity | Humidity | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (relative humidity)

Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters configured.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HS1HT-Z  supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Association group 1: Lifeline association group Maximum supported node is 1. Include command classes: Battery report, multilevel sensor report, and Device Reset Locally.
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Multilevel sensor temperature

Association group 2: Root Device group(multilevel sensor temperature) Maximum supported nodes are 5. 1- multilevel Sensor reports status of the temperature via Lifeline. 2-When the sensor detects status of the temperature, the device will be triggered.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Multilevel sensor humidity

Association group 3: Root Device group(multilevel sensor humidity) Maximum supported nodes are 5. 1-multilevel Sensor reports status of the humidity via Lifeline. 2-When the sensor detects status of the humidity , the device will be triggered.
This group supports 5 nodes.
