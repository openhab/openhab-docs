## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the TZWP-100.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Countdown timer | Automatic turning off in minutes, 0 to disable |
| 2 | Device status after power failure | Define how the plug will react after the power supply is back on |
| 3 | LED indicator | Set the intensity of the LED indicator |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Countdown timer

Automatic turning off in minutes, 0 to disable

Values in the range 0 to 254 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Device status after power failure

Define how the plug will react after the power supply is back on

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Always off |
| 1 | Remember status |
| 2 | Always on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Remember status).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: LED indicator

Set the intensity of the LED indicator

Values in the range 0 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZWP-100 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
The plug will send it's status to the node in this group whenever the status of the plug changes.  
Lifeline is normally used to send the plug status to the main controller / gateway.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Control other devices

The plug will send Basic Set control signals to the nodes in this group whenever the status of the  
plug changes. This will work like a master/slave solution.

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
