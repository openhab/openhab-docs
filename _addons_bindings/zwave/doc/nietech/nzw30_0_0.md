| 3 | ledIndicator | Set the LED light behavior |
| 4 | invert | Invert on & off on the physical switch |
| 5 | autoOff | Automatically turn switch off after this number of seconds |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 3: ledIndicator

Set the LED light behavior
This setting controls the operation of the LED indicator light on the bottom of the switch.  The options are 0,1,2,3.  They are described below.

  * 0 (default): Turn LED indicator on when switch is off

  * 2: Indicator LED is always off
  * 3: Indicator LED is always on
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Turn LED indicator on when switch is off |
| 1 | Turn LED indicator on when switch is on |
| 2 | Indicator LED is always off |
| 3 | Indicator LED is always on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Turn LED indicator on when switch is off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: invert

Invert on & off on the physical switch
Invert what the top and bottom of the switch does.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: autoOff

Automatically turn switch off after this number of seconds

Values in the range 0 to 32767 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:

|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The NZW30 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
An association command class that allows the device to communicate with other Z-Wave devices directly -- such as sending BASIC REPORT whenever the switch is turned on or off.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
