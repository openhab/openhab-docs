## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MP22Z supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Association group 1
This Device supports Lifeline (association group 1) supporting 1 node for lifeline communication. Group 1 must be assigned the Node ID of the primary controller where unsolicited notifications will be sent. The Z-Wave controller should set this association automatically after inclusion. Lifeline association only supports the “Device Reset Locally” function. Refer to the instructions of your controller for any available details on how this can be set.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Left outlet send basic set

Support 2 groups, each group max support 2 devices

Association group 2 supports 2 nodes.
