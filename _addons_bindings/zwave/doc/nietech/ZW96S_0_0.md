The ZW96S supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This zwave outlet is bulit-in a zwave 800 chip which is more reliable and faster, have a longer range and are more secure than the 700 series. It can up to 1300ft in the open range if your hub support Z-Wave LR. The device has IP65 Weather-resistant housing of this zwave plug is ideal for the Garden, Backyard. It has max loading is up to 15A and 1875W. Its power is 125V, 60Hz. 

### Inclusion Information

Put the Z-wave interface controller into “Add” mode, triple press the Program button (A). LED will blink rapidly. It will be included to network. (Once your controller confirmed, refresh the Z-Wave network to optimize performance.)

### Exclusion Information

Put the Z-Wave interface controller into "Remove" mode, triple press the Program button (A). LED will blink rapidly. It will be excluded to network

### General Usage Information

Manual reset: click the button twice quickly, then hold for at least 10 seconds.

Host reset: Remove it from the host and the device is factory reset.

| 1 | LED Indicator | Status LED Configuration |
| 2 | Auto Turn-Off Timer | Timer to make the switch turn off automatically after the switch turned on |
| 4 | Auto Turn-On Timer | Timer to make the switch turn on automatically after the switch turned off |
| 6 | Restores state after power failure | Restores state after power failure |

### Parameter 1: LED Indicator

Status LED Configuration
value=00 (default) LED is On when switch (light) is On

value=01 LED is On when the switch (light) is Off

Value: 02 led off, led no work.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | outlet on,led on |
| 1 | outlet on,led off |
| 2 | led off, led no work |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (outlet on,led on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Auto Turn-Off Timer

Timer to make the switch turn off automatically after the switch turned on
This parameter can access you to set a timer to make the switch turn

off automatically after the switch turned on.The number entered as

value corresponds to number of minutes. (LED flashes twice when

the configuration parameter changed)
Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Auto Turn-On Timer

Timer to make the switch turn on automatically after the switch turned off

Values in the range 0 to 65535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Restores state after power failure

Restores state after power failure
Value=0 - The switch is off regardless of the state prior to power failure.

Value=1 - The switch is on regardless of the state prior to power failure.

Value=2(default) - This switch will be return to state prior to the power failure after power is restored.

Adjust LED brightness (quickly press 8x: change Parameter.)

(Green LED flashes twice to confirm the setting is successful.)

Parameter=7, Size=1,

Value=0 \--- Bright

Value=1 \--- Medium

Value=2 \--- Low (default)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | The switch is off regardless of the state prior to power failure |
| 1 | The switch is on regardless of the state prior to power failure |
| 2 | This switch will be return to state prior to the power failure after p |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (This switch will be return to state prior to the power failure after p).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZW96S supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Association group 1
This Device supports Lifeline (association group 1) supporting 1 node for lifeline communication.

Group 1 must be assigned the Node ID of the primary controller where unsolicited notifications will be sent.

The Z-Wave controller should set this association automatically after inclusion.

Lifeline association only supports the “Device Reset Locally” function. Refer to the instructions of your controller for any available details on how this can be set.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
