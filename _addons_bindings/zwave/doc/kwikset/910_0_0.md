Values in the range 0 to 15 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```5```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 33: first four most significant bytes of the SKU

SKU (length = 8 bytes)
The configuration parameters 33 and 34 are used to set and get the SKU part numbers. The SKU is made up of 8 bytes. Each parameter consists of four bytes of data. Parameter 33 contains the first four most significant bytes of the SKU, while parameter 34 contains the four least significant bytes of the SKU.

When setting the SKU, it must be done in two set commands, one for each parameter. The order of programming the SKU does not matter.

Setting parameter 33 will program the first four bytes of the SKU. Setting parameter 34 will program the last 4 bytes of the SKU. Most printable values are accepted for the set command.

When getting the SKU, it must be done in two get commands, one for each parameter. The order of getting the SKU does not matter.

Getting parameter 33 will retrieve the first four bytes of the SKU. Getting parameter 34 will retrieve the last 4 bytes of the SKU. This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 32 to 126 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```32```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_33_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 34: four least significant bytes of the SKU.

SKU (length = 8 bytes)
The configuration parameters 33 and 34 are used to set and get the SKU part numbers. The SKU is made up of 8 bytes. Each parameter consists of four bytes of data. Parameter 33 contains the first four most significant bytes of the SKU, while parameter 34 contains the four least significant bytes of the SKU.

When setting the SKU, it must be done in two set commands, one for each parameter. The order of programming the SKU does not matter.

Setting parameter 33 will program the first four bytes of the SKU. Setting parameter 34 will program the last 4 bytes of the SKU. Most printable values are accepted for the set command.

When getting the SKU, it must be done in two get commands, one for each parameter. The order of getting the SKU does not matter.

Getting parameter 33 will retrieve the first four bytes of the SKU. Getting parameter 34 will retrieve the last 4 bytes of the SKU.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 32 to 126 may be set.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Kwikset SmartCode 910 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline Supports the following types of unsolicited messages: Battery Report - sends periodic battery reports containing the battery percentage. Door Lock Operation Report - upon power up, this message will be sent to allow the controller to sync up with the current lock status. Notification Report - many notification types will be sent for status and alarms. The following notification types are supported: Access Control (V2), Home Security (V2), and Power Management (V2). Device Reset Locally Notification - this message will be sent to notify the smart home controller that the lock is resetting back to factory defaults and will be leaving the network.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Group 2

This group will provide all Notification reports as described for the Lifeline. This group allows other controllers, other than the lifeline, to receive these types of unsolicited messages as well.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
