### General Usage Information

Like most Z-Wave locks, the lock doesn't update its status (locked or unlocked) but signals it through alarms instead.  Here is some sample output from the alarm_raw channel:

Locked by Controller:

{"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_REMOTE\_LOCK","level":"1","type":"ACCESS_CONTROL","event":"3","status":"255"}

  
Unlocked by Controller:

{"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_REMOTE\_UNLOCK","level":"1","type":"ACCESS_CONTROL","event":"4","status":"255"}

  
Locked by Hand (key or knob):

{"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_MANUAL\_LOCK","level":"1","type":"ACCESS_CONTROL","event":"1","status":"255"}

  
Unlocked by Hand (key or knob):

{"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_MANUAL\_UNLOCK","level":"1","type":"ACCESS_CONTROL","event":"2","status":"255"}

  
Locked by Keypad:

{"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_KEYPAD\_LOCK","level":"0","type":"ACCESS_CONTROL","event":"5","status":"255"}

  
Unlocked by Keypad (Code #2):

{"notification":"ACCESS\_CONTROL\_\_KEYPAD\_UNLOCK","code":"2","level":"2","type":"ACCESS_CONTROL","event":"6","parameter-1":"2","status":"255"}

  
When unlocked by keypad, code, type, and parameter-1 all indicate the code number (2 in the above example)

Sample rule in Openhab to update the lock status, with Door\_Lock linked to the lock's lock\_door channel, and Door\_Lock\_Alarm linked to its alarm_raw channel.  Make sure you have the JSONPath Transformation installed under Paper UI - Add-ons - Transformations:

rule "Door lock status updates"  
when  
        Item Door\_Lock\_Alarm changed  
then  
        switch(transform("JSONPATH", "$.event", Door\_Lock\_Alarm.state.toString)) {  
                case "1", case "3", case "5" : Door_Lock.postUpdate(ON)  
                case "2", case "4" : Door_Lock.postUpdate(OFF)  
                case "6" : {  
                        var userName = ""  
                        switch(transform("JSONPATH", "$.code", Door\_Lock\_Alarm.state.toString)) {  
                                case "1": userName = "Bill"  
                                case "2": userName = "Ted"  
                                default: userName = "Unknown"  
                        }  
                        mailActions.sendMail("bill@example.com", "Door lock opened by code", "Door lock opened by " + userName)  
                        Door_Lock.postUpdate(OFF)  
                }              
        }  
end

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the GED1800 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Lock | lock_door | lock_door | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm Raw | alarm_raw | alarm_raw |  | String | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Door Lock
Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel is of type ```lock_door``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Locked |
| OFF | Unlocked |

### Alarm Raw
Provides alarm parameters as json string.

The ```alarm_raw``` channel is of type ```alarm_raw``` and supports the ```String``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.
This channel sets, and provides the alarm state as a JSON string. It is designed for use in rules.
### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GED1800 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Per Z-Wave Plus requirements, group 1 is assigned to the Lifeline group and can only support 1 node.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Doorlock Notify Report

Association group 2 is identified as the “Doorlock notify report” group.  It allows at most 5 other nodes to be associated with the lock and will provide all Notification Reports, via the Command Class Notification, generated by the lock.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
