Door lock status LED blinks every 6 seconds. Factory default is ON.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (ON).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1_00000001``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 31: Auto Lock

Automatically re-locks door 30 seconds after unlocking.
Lock automatically re-locks door 30 seconds after unlocking. OFF position is factory default. If this switch is turned on, it will be disabled if all codes are deleted from the lock.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1_00000002``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 31: Buzzer

Internal Buzzer
Internal buzzer enabled. Factory default is ON. It is recommended that the buzzer is left ON during programming.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | On |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (ON).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_31_1_00000004``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a read only parameter.


### Parameter 33: SKU (1st half)

First 4 bytes of SKU
Configuration parameters 33 and 34 are used to set and get the SKU part numbers. The SKU is made up of 8 bytes. Each parameter consists of four bytes of data. Parameter 33 contains the first four most significant bytes of the SKU, while parameter 34 contains the four least significant bytes of the SKU.

When setting the SKU, it must be done in two set commands, one for each parameter. The order of programming the SKU does not matter.

Setting parameter 33 will program the first four bytes of the SKU. Setting parameter 34 will program the last 4 bytes of the SKU. Most printable values are accepted for the set command.

When getting the SKU, it must be done in two get commands, one for each parameter. The order of getting the SKU does not matter.

Getting parameter 33 will retrieve the first four bytes of the SKU. Getting parameter 34 will retrieve the last 4 bytes of the SKUThis is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 0 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_33_4_7FFF0000``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 34: SKU (2nd half)

### Parameter 40: Factory Default

Reset to factory default settings
The configuration parameter 40 is a one-byte field, used to set the lock to its default setting, known as a factory reset command.

Reading this parameter will always return a value of 0.

Writing a value of 1 to this parameter will cause both the lock and Z-Wave card to reset back to their default settings and will remove itself from the network. All network information, including associations, will be cleared.This is an advanced parameter and will therefore not show in the user interface without entering advanced mode.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_40_1_wo``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.
This is a write only parameter.

### Lock Timeout

Sets the time after which the door will auto lock.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```doorlock_timeout``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The GED2150 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Per Z-Wave Plus requirements, group 1 is assigned to the Lifeline group and can only support 1 node.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Doorlock Notify Report

Association group 2 is identified as the “Doorlock notify report” group. It allows at most 5 other nodes to be associated with the lock and will provide all Notification Reports, via the Command Class Notification, generated by the lock.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
