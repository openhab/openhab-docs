# PIR Z-Wave PIR Motion Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *PIR*, manufactured by *Ecolink* with the thing type UID of ```eco_pir1_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Motion Detector*, defining Motion sensors/detectors.

The PIR supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PIR does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The sensor has two Association groups available for up to five Z-Wave Node IDs each.  
Association group one is intended for but not limited to controllers. All nodes whose Node ID  
that have been set in Association group one will receive all unsolicited Alarm Report frames,  
and Basic Report frames of 0x00 and 0xFF. Association group two is intended for any device

that is controllable with a Basic Set of 0xFF such as lights, sirens, or chimes.  
When a sensor such as a door or window sensor is opened/faulted, the sensor will send a Basic  
Report to nodes in Association group one and a Basic Set of 0xFF to Association group two.  
When the door or window is closed the sensor will send a Basic Report of 0x00 to only group  
one. The Configuration command class can configure the sensor to send Basic Sets of 0x00 to  
nodes in group two (turning devices off). See Configuration Command Class.

### Wakeup Information

The PIR does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

By default, a sensor is configured to send Wake Up Notification frames every three hours. A  
controller may change the duration between Wake Up Notification frames to be between one  
hour and one week in increments of two hundred seconds with the Wake Up Interval Set  
command. The sensor will send Wake Up Notification frames to the Node ID specified in the  
Wake Up Set Interval command or 255 if no valid nodes have been set.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the PIR -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the PIR.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 99 | Toggle sending clear message to group 2 | Toggle sending clear message to group 2 |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 99: Toggle sending clear message to group 2

Toggle sending clear message to group 2
Set to 0 to disable sending a fault clear message (00) to group 2 when the device has cleared.

The Configuration command class can be utilized to enable Basic Sets of 0x00 on a fault  
restore to nodes in Group 2 with a Configuration Set command of Parameter number 0x63  
(decimal 99), a size of 1, and a Configuration value of 0xFF (decimal 255). Changing the  
configuration value to 0 disables the feature.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable sending clear message |
| 1 | Send clear message to group 2 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable sending clear message).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_99_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PIR supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2


This group supports 5 nodes.
