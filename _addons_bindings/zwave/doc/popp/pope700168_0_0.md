The POPE700168 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The POPE700168 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The POPP Rain-Sensor is a Rain Measuring Sensor Device for Europe

### Inclusion Information

Put controller in inclusion mode, push the Z-Wave button once

### Exclusion Information

Put controller in exclusion mode, push the Z-Wave button once

### Wakeup Information

The POPE700168 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the POPE700168 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Basic value | basic_number |  |  | 
| Sensor (general) | sensor_general |  | Number | 
| Sensor (rain rate) | sensor_rainrate | Humidity | Number | 
| Water meter (amps) | meter_water_cubic_meters | Energy | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Basic value

Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Sensor (general)



The ```sensor_general``` channel supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Sensor (rain rate)

Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_rainrate``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Water meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous water consumption.

The ```meter_water_cubic_meters``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the POPE700168.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Rain Counter | total count of rain |
| 2 | Rain Start Command | Send rain start command to group 2 |
| 3 | Rain Stop Command | Send rain stop to group 2 |
| 4 | Meter Multiplier | Adapt the display |
| 5 | Heavy Rain | Threshold defines heavy rain condition |
| 6 | Heavy Rain Start Command | Send heavy rain start to group 3 |
| 7 | Heavy Rain Stop Command | Send heavy rain stop to group 3 |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Rain Counter

total count of rain
Ths values shows the total count of rain from the moment of inclusion in mm waterlevel. By writing this value this counter can be reset. Size: 2 Byte, Default Value: 0
Values in the range 0 to 32000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Rain Start Command

Send rain start command to group 2
This BASIC Set Command value is sent out into Association Group 2 when the device detects start of rain Size: 1 Byte, Default Value: 99
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Rain Stop Command

Send rain stop to group 2
This BASIC Set Command value is sent out into Association Group 2 when the device detects stop of rain Size: 1 Byte, Default Value: 0
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Meter Multiplier

Adapt the display
This multiplier allows to adapt the display to certain controllers not being able to handle very low numbers. Size: 2 Byte, Default Value: 1 only 1/10/100/1000
Values in the range 1 to 1000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Heavy Rain

Threshold defines heavy rain condition
This threshold defines when a heavy rain condition is hit. In most countries this is defined as > 15 mm rain per hour. The default value however is to turn this function off. Size: 1 Byte, Default Value: 255
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Heavy Rain Start Command

Send heavy rain start to group 3
This BASIC Set Command value is sent out into Association Group 3 when the device detects start of heavy rain Size: 1 Byte, Default Value: 99
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Heavy Rain Stop Command

Send heavy rain stop to group 3
This BASIC Set Command value is sent out into Association Group 3 when the device detects stop of heavy rain Size: 1 Byte, Default Value: 0
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The POPE700168 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Switching Command when Rain (> 0 mm/h)

Switching Command when Rain (> 0 mm/h). Basic Set Comand is sent.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Heavy Rain detected. Basic Set Comand is sent.


This group supports 5 nodes.
