## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 005107 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | Door | Switch | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number | 
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Binary Sensor

Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)

Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the 005107.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Siren  triggering mode | Sets the tamper triggering mode when removed from the holder |
| 2 | Temperature adjustments | Temperature correction with positive and negative offset values |
| 3 | Send unsolicited  temperature report | Threshold temperature to send unsolicited report. 10 = 1°C |
| 4 | Send unsolicited  temperature report after N wake up | Send unsolicited temperature report after N wake up |
| 5 | Switch mode  | Switch mode : siren only, flash only, flash + siren |

### Parameter 1: Siren  triggering mode

Sets the tamper triggering mode when removed from the holder

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Trigger, when removed from holder |
| 1 | Trigger, when removed, and turn off, when placed back. |
| 2 | Don't trigger at all |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Trigger, when removed from holder).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature adjustments

Temperature correction with positive and negative offset values
Temperature correction. For positive value 10 = 1 °C, for negative value x = 256 - (T°C \* 10).

Example, if need shift -2.6°C, value calculate: 256 - (2.6 \* 10) = 230.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 255 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Temperature adjustments |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Send unsolicited  temperature report

Threshold temperature to send unsolicited report. 10 = 1°C
In 0.1°C (Default 10)
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Send unsolicited  temperature report after N wake up

Send unsolicited temperature report after N wake up
Send unsolicited temperature report after N wake up

If the value is set, after N wake up number (measurement is every 4 minutes) the temperature report will be sent.

By default it's 15 = every 1 hour
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Send unsolicited temperature report after N wake up |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```15```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Switch mode 

Switch mode : siren only, flash only, flash + siren
