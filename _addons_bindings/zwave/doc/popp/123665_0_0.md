| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (power factor) | meter_powerfactor | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (volts)

Indicates the instantaneous voltage.

The ```meter_voltage``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (power factor)

Indicates the instantaneous power factor.

The ```meter_powerfactor``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (amps)

Indicates the instantaneous current consumption.

The ```meter_current``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 5 configuration parameters available in the 123665.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Watt Meter Report Period | If the setting is configured for 1hour (set value =720), the device will report its instant power consumption every 1 hour to Z-Wave Controller. (in seconds) |
| 2 | KWH Meter Report Period | if the setting is configured for 1hour (set value =6), the device will report its Accumulated Power Consumption (KW/h) every hour (in seconds) |
| 4 | Threshold of KWh for Load caution  | This is a warning when the KWh of load over the preset threshold value, if the Accumulated Power Consumption exceeds the setting value the device will send a warning alarm command to the controller. |
| 5 | Ignore start level |  |
| 11 | Ignore start level |  |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 123665 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Switch State


This group supports 5 nodes.
