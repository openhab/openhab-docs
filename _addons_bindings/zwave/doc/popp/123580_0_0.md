## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 17 configuration parameters available in the 123580.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Set LED indication mode |  |
| 2 | Automatic switch off time | If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time (in seconds) |
| 3 | RF Off command | Defines how to interpret RF Off command. Can be used in conjunction with Auto Off function: Ignore - to switch on the light by motion detectors and switch it off after some amount of time: in case of multiple motion detectors each would try to switch the |
| 4 | Ignore start level |  |
| 5 | Speed for fast dimming | Time to dim on button presses and Set command (if it has no duration specified). If not 0, dimming will be done smoothly to preserve bulb life. Set in 10ms steps. |
