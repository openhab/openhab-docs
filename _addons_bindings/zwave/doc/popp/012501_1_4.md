The 012501 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

An electric strike is an access control device used to lock and release doors. Electric strikes are installed in or on the doorframe and work in conjunction with mechanical door locks, on the principle of electronically controlling the rotation of the keeper. Allowing for door opening without manual retraction of the mechanical door lock. This product combines a 16 mm thick strike lock (that will fit into almost all door formats) with a Z-Wave plus empowered wireless control.

The lock mechanics and the Z-Wave control are operated by a 9V block battery or an external 8-12V AC / 8-24V DC transformer. The Z-Wave control accepts commands to open or close the strike. Depending on a configuration parameter the door will be looked automatically after a certain time even if no ‘close’ command was sent. According to the connected Z-Wave Gateway all actions of the Strike Lock will be recorded with a time stamp.

The device is a secure Z-Wave Plus device and can be used in one wireless Z-Wave network with other certified devices regardless of origin and brand. It supports secure communication if the central controller supports secure communication as well. 

### Inclusion Information

Pressing the Z-Wave button for one second includes the device.

It is not allowed to operate the device in a non-secure environment. This means that the including controller must support Secure Command Class.

### Exclusion Information

A single click on the button will exclude the device.

### General Usage Information

The Strike-Lock has a IP 20 protection class. Because of that it is not recommended to install the device directly outdoors. 

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 012501 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Door Lock | lock_door | lock_door | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Door Lock
Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel is of type ```lock_door``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Locked |
| OFF | Unlocked |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (general)
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the 012501.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Auto-Close | Automated Close after Opening |
| 1 | Off-Command | Value of Off-Command |
| 2 | On-Command | Value of On-Command |
|  | Lock Timeout | Sets the time after which the door will auto lock |

### Parameter 0: Auto-Close

Automated Close after Opening
0: No automated close after command ‘open’  
1-127: Close again after x seconds (Default 3) 
Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_0_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 1: Off-Command

Value of Off-Command
Value of Off-Command (Parameter number 1, Size 1) 
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: On-Command

Value of On-Command

### Lock Timeout

Sets the time after which the door will auto lock.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```doorlock_timeout``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 012501 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Device status

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: External Input

Action on External Dry Input

Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
