# 009501 Popp 09501 Flow Stop
This describes the Z-Wave device *009501*, manufactured by *Popp & Co* with the thing type UID of ```popp_009501_01_002```.
This version of the device is limited to firmware version 1.2

The 009501 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Flow Stop moves the operating handle of a ball valve allowing to stopping the flow of gas or water. It can be mounted non-intrusive on any pipe size between 0.5 and 1.5 inch. This means the original water or gas pipe will not be opened or manipulated and it is possible to remove the Flow stop again without any damage to the water or gas pipe. Installing the Flow stop will not tamper or change any security measure applied or your gas or water installation.  
The device is equipped with a powerful 12 V motor providing sufficient torque to open or close any ball valve within 10 seconds. A complete manual operation of the valve remains possible due to the clutch release bearing.

### Wakeup Information

The 009501 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
