The POPE700397 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Wall Plug Switch Outdoor can be placed between a wall outlet for plugs type F and electric devices, plugged in by a cord. It can switch all loads up to 3500 W. The plug switch is IP 44 rated and can, therefore, be used both in dry as well as humid environments in- and outdoor.

Switching is controlled by the local button or wirelessly. The use of the local button and the behavior on wireless commands can be configured using configuration parameters. When detached from the control of local leads the button on the device can be used to trigger scenes in a central gateway. A single click and double click are distinguished.

The device is also measuring the mains voltage supply reporting mains voltage and mains frequency. Additionally, the power consumption of the attached load is monitored as well.

All metering values can be requested from the central controller and will be reported unsolicited if configured. 

### Inclusion Information

Tripple Click the button for inclusion. 

### Exclusion Information

Tripple Click the button for exclusion.

### General Usage Information

The device is able to switch electric loads up to 3500 W and can be switched wirelessly or using the local button.  The connected load is measured and reported. Trigger values can define unsolicited power reports. The device includes a virtual circuit breaker. The configuration values 26-28 define the behavior of this function. Depending on the configuration parameter 4 the local button with either control the local load or sends scene activation commands to the central gateway.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The POPE700397 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control other devices

Control other devices on single click of the button. BASIC command (on/off) is sent according to switching state of the load.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
