The 05438 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/230) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the 05438 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Electric meter (kWh)

Indicates the energy consumption (kWh).

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the 05438.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | LED indication mode | Set LED indication mode. |
| 2 | Automatically switch off after x seconds. | If not zero, automatically switch device off after a user defined time |
| 3 | What to do on RF off command. | Defines how to interpret RF Off-Command. |
| 5 | Restore switch state after power cycle. | Defines if the switch should restore switch state. |
| 20 | Specify the consumption of the load in watts | Maximum load 3500 Watts |
| 21 | LED Off color | Color for Off state. |
| 22 | LED On color. | Color for On state. |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: LED indication mode

Set LED indication mode.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Show switch state (default) |
| 2 | Operated by Indicator Command Class |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Show switch state (default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Automatically switch off after x seconds.

If not zero, automatically switch device off after a user defined time
If not zero, automatically switch device off after a user defined time.

- 0 -> Disabled
- 1 - 65535 -> Enabled, automatically switch off after x seconds.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: What to do on RF off command.

Defines how to interpret RF Off-Command.
Can be used in conjunction with Auto Off function:

- Ignore – to switch on the light by motion detectors and switch it off after some amount of time: in case of multiple motion detectors each would try to switch the light off that would break logics;
- Switch on – to switch on the light on both ON and OFF paddle press on the remote and switch it off after some amount of time.
- Button OFF click will still work (if button operations are not disabled).
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Switch off (default) |
| 1 | Ignore |
| 2 | Switch on |
| 3 | Switch on if load is off, else switch off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Switch off (default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Restore switch state after power cycle.

Defines if the switch should restore switch state.
Defines if the switch should restore switch state to the last state prior to device power off (power cycle).
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No, turn off |
| 1 | Yes, default |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Yes, default).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 05438 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Send Reports on switch state change.


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Controlled by buttons


This group supports 5 nodes.
