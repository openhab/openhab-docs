The 004407 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 004407 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This product combines a certified carbon monoxide detector with a plug-in Z-Wave module to form a wirelessly reporting carbon monoxide sensor. The carbon monoxide detector is certified according to EN 50270:1999, EN 60335-1:1994 as well as EN 50291:2001 and satisfies all contemporary legal requirements.

There is no defined level of carbon monoxide that will result in an alarm. The danger of CO is a result of the total level of CO in the air plus the duration of exposure. A Z-Wave alarm will be sent out when one of the following conditions were met:

  * CO level above 43 ppm for a duration of 60 minutes
  * CO level above 80 ppm for a duration of 10 minutes
  * CO level above 150 ppm for a duration of 2 minutes

### Inclusion Information

Pressing the Z-Wave button for one second includes the device. If the button is pressed for at least 2 seconds, the inclusion will be done without the Security Command Class.

### Exclusion Information

A single click on the Z-Wave button will exclude the device.

### Wakeup Information

The 004407 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Wakeup is done by single push of the Z-Wave button.

| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (CARBON_MONOXIDE) | sensor_co | sensor_co |  | Number | 
| Alarm (system) | alarm_system | alarm_system |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (tamper) | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (CO) | alarm_co | alarm_co |  | Switch | 
| Alarm (general) | alarm_general | alarm_general | Alarm | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (CARBON_MONOXIDE)
Indicates the CO level.

The ```sensor_co``` channel is of type ```sensor_co``` and supports the ```Number``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Alarm (system)
Indicates if a system alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_system``` channel is of type ```alarm_system``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (tamper)
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (CO)
Indicates if the carbon monoxide alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_co``` channel is of type ```alarm_co``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (general)
Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel is of type ```alarm_general``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Alarm``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the 004407.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Value of ON-Command |  |
| 2 | Value of OFF-Command |  |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Value of ON-Command



Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Value of OFF-Command



Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 004407 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 10 nodes.

### Group 2: Switching Command when Alarm


Association group 2 supports 10 nodes.
