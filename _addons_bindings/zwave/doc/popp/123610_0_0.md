The 123610 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This is a switch plug that can be placed between a standard Schuko (Type F) wall outlet and electric devices, plugged in by cord. It can switch all electrical loads up to 3500 W. The device is IP 20 rated and can therefore only be used on dry environments. Switching is controlled wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally using a toggleing button. A blue LED indicates the switching status. An automatic 'Off' function and programmable switching behavior make the device a very flexible tool for the inhouse lighting

| 1 | Set LED indication mode |  |
| 2 | Automatic switch off time | If not zero, automatically switch off after a user defined time (in seconds) |
| 3 | RF Off command | RF Off command |
| 5 | Restore switch state after power cycle | Restore switch state after power cycle |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Set LED indication mode



The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | On when switch on |
| 2 | On when switch off |
