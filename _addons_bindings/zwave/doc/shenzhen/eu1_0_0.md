The EU-1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Light Switch is an intelligent device that can be remotely controlled through Z-Wave network and radio waves. In the Z-Wave network communications, light switch can be connected to any Z-Wave gateway. When using radio waves, light switch can be used in conjunction with Z-Wave gateway. The frequency of radio waves used by gateway and switch is like this: different countries or areas, the radio frequency is different. Each light switch has a unique ID code. When we add or remove the switch from the alarm host, just place light switch in the Z-Wave network range of gateway. Then we can easily find the switch through the device ID code. In communication with gateway, light switch not only can send signals to Z-Wave gateway, but also can receive signals from it. When touch the button on light switch, it would send signals to Z-Wave gateway, then gateway can correctly display the switch on / off state; when light switch receives signals from gateway, the switch state would be remotely switched on/off.

### Inclusion Information

  1. Connect switch to power source, after making it powred, please do not operate it within 20s.
  2. Make sure Light Switch is powered.
  3. Set Z-Wave gateway into inclusion mode (Refer to gateway user manual)
  4. Touch the button three times continuously within 1.5 second, then Light Switch will enter inclusion mode. Meanwhile, LED light would flash red color five times on and off alternately.
  5. Light Switch will be detected and included in the Z-Wave network.
  6. Wait for gateway to configure the switch.

**Note:** If Light Switch has not been added to Z-Wave network, it can enter inclusion mode automatically when it is powered on. But in order to run this function, should let the controller enter into inclusion first before making Light Switch powered on.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Make sure Light Switch is powered.
  2. Set Z-Wave gateway into exclusion mode (Refer to gateway user manual)
  3. Touch the button three times continuously within 1.5 second, then Light Switch will enter exclusion mode. Meanwhile, LED light would flash red color once then pink color 4 times on and off alternately.
  4. Wait for gateway to delete the switch.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the EU-1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the EU-1.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Relay On/Off Status Saved Enable | Restore switch status on power restore. |
| 2 | Back light Enable | Enable back light when Light Switch is powered on. |
| 3 | Relay On/Off Indicate | Switch on LED indicator. |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Relay On/Off Status Saved Enable

Restore switch status on power restore.
This parameter defines the on/off status of relay needs saving or not. The status will be saved when relay status is changed if this parameter is set to '1'; otherwise the relay status is not saved. The Light Switch will restore the relay On/Off status when is powered on again.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not save the On/Off status |
| 1 | Save and restore the relay On/Off status |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Save and restore the relay On/Off status).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Back light Enable

Enable back light when Light Switch is powered on.
This parameter defines the back light state of touch buton. The back light LED would be on when Light Switch is powered on if this parameter is set to '1', otherwise the back light LED would be off. The default value is '1'.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable back light LED |
| 1 | Enable back light LED |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enable back light LED).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Relay On/Off Indicate

Switch on LED indicator.
This parameter defines the relay state. The LED will be turned on with pink color when the button is touched to turn on relay if this parameter is set to '1', otherwise the LED state is not changed.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not change LED state when on |
| 1 | Pink LED state when on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Pink LED state when on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The EU-1 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
GROUP 1 is lifeline service that assigned to Light Switch status. It enables Light Switch to send reports to Z-Wave Gateway whenever some button is touched. This Group Support: SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT, DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

GROUP 2 allows Sending Binary Switch Report to associated devices in this group. This group is mapped to Endpoint 0. This Group Support: SWITCH\_BINARY\_REPORT

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
