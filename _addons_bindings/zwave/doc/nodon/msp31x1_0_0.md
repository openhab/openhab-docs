Send status if local button is used to associated devices.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Follow Comp State

Send status if local button is used to associated devices.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4:  Metering High Threshold

Send ON/OFF command to associated devices if threshold reached
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Metering Low Threshold

Send ON/OFF command to associated devices if threshold reached
