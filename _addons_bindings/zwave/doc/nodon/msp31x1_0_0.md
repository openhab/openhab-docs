The MSP-3-1-X1 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The NodOn Micro Smart Plug can be controlled by any kind of Z-Wave® (or Z-Wave Plus®) gateway or other Z-Wave® controller (standalone mode) such as the NodOn® Soft Remote or Octan Remote.   
It existed in both standard, Type E (French) or Schuko (German). Its very small design and volume allow easy integration, without obstructing nearby power holes on a power strip. Furthermore, it can perform Power and Energy Metering.   
The NodOn Smart Plug is based on brand new 500 series Z-Wave® module from Sigma Designs®, and support all the new features of Z-Wave Plus® standard:   
Longer range (up to 40m), lower power consumption, higher data rate transmission, and many more new features.

When the Micro Smart Plug is switched ON (respectively OFF) using the local button, it will send ON (respectively OFF) command to the associated devices. No command is sent if the Micro Smart Plug is switched ON or OFF wirelessly.

This group is configurable through the parameter 3.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Follow Comp State

Send status if local button is used to associated devices.
When the Micro Smart Plug is switched ON (respectively OFF) using the local button, it will send OFF (respectively ON) command to the associated devices. No command is sent if the Micro Smart Plug is switched ON or OFF wirelessly.

This group is configurable through the parameter 3.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4:  Metering High Threshold

Send ON/OFF command to associated devices if threshold reached
When the Micro Smart Plug reaches over the high threshold of power defined by the configuration parameter, it will send OFF or ON command to the associated devices.

This group is configurable through the parameter 25 and 27.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Metering Low Threshold

Send ON/OFF command to associated devices if threshold reached
When the Micro Smart Plug reaches below the low threshold of power defined by the configuration parameter, it will send OFF or ON command to the associated devices.

This group is configurable through the parameters 26 and 27.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Metering - Report
