0 = Lamp/relay is switched on and remains so until any new motion event (local or remote) is received. It then works normally via current  
motion evaluation.  
Notice – during the day, this mode cannot be ended remotely due  
to motion events not being transmitted – only via local motion sen-  
sor if enabled.

1 - 209 = Lamp/relay is switched on and remains so until after a specified timeout once a new motion event (local or remote) is received. It then  
works normally via current motion evaluation.

### Parameter 15: SEQUENCE_ TIME

Sequence timing
Time in [100 milliseconds] of maximum delay between BASIC ON and BASIC  
OFF (and vice versa) to consider this as a sequence. It is typically 1 second,  
but can be exceptionally longer due to retransmissions and overload – in this  
case, a longer interval can be allowed (up to 5 seconds).

nal motion sensor is not used for evaluating the behaviour of the lamp (SLAMP)  
relay (SPIR) and groups 2 and 3. Events are, however, still transmitted to the  
Lifeline, and the device can be controlled via remote motion sensors.

0 = BASIC SET to motion sensor endpoint ignored, BASIC to root is  
mapped to relay endpoint, (SPIR) motion sensor still enabled

  
1 - 209 = Internal motion sensor is disabled for specified timeout after BASIC  
SET 0x00 to motion endpoint.  
Timeout:  
1..100 – 1 second (1) to 100 seconds (100) in 1-second resolution  
101..200 – 1 minute (101) to 100 minutes (200) in 1-minute resolution

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The IS140-2 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline
- Device Reset Locally (immediately)  
- Notifications:  
0x09 (System) – Hardware failure with manufacturer proprietary code (0x03)  
0x09 (System) – Software failure with manufacturer proprietary code (0x04)  
0x07 (Home security) – Motion Begin event (0x08)  
0x07 (Home security) – Motion End event (0x00, 0x08)  
- Binary Switch Report (SPIR)  
- Binary Switch Report (SBIN)  
- Multilevel Switch Report (SMUL)  
- Multilevel Sensor Report – value of internal ambient light sensor  
- Central scene notification (STOGGLE)  
Motion Begin and Motion End events are sent along with frames to group 3.  
If multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor  
endpoint.  
Switch Report is sent immediately upon a change of status along with  
frames to group 2. If multichannel association is created the events are sent  
from lamp/relay endpoint.  
Multilevel Sensor Report is sent a maximum of once per 1 minute  
(if the value has changed by at least 3%) and a minimum of once per 15 min-  
utes (if the value has not changed). If the ambient light value is old (cannot  
be measured because of permanent light), the value is not transmitted via  
lifeline. Multilevel Sensor Report can also be added to some other events to  
send in bulk. If multichannel association is created the events are sent from  
light sensor endpoint.  
Central scene notification is sent as reaction to user interaction. If multichan-  
nel association is created the events are sent from toggle button endpoint.

All notifications to lifeline are sent as sensor states regardless of sensor  
settings and states as SLAVE\_MODE, LOCAL\_DISABLED and MOTION_  
ENABLE

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Control: Key01

On/Off control
Group 2 is used for directly controlling Z-Wave devices via BASIC SET com-  
mands through the evaluation of movement and light, as with internal use  
(so that all of these devices work together). This is intended for use especially  
with third-party devices that do not implement reactions for motion events.  
BASIC_SET and similar Z-Wave commands are not retransmitted intention-  
ally to slaves and must be sent to slave devices via the controlling device  
simultaneously. Only for use in master-slave system, multi-device control is  
not possible.  
Group 2 is evaluated and frames are transmitted there also in SLAVE_  
MODE, regardless of LOCAL\_DISABLED state and when MOTION\_ENABLE  
is off (not using internal motion sensor, just reacting to remote motion events  
in this case).  
If multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor  
endpoint.

Association group 2 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Notification: Motion

Motion Begin/End
Group 3 sends MOTION\_BEGIN and MOTION\_END frames.  
MOTION_BEGIN frame = Notification 0x07 (Home security) –  
Motion detection without location (0x08)  
MOTION_END frame = Notification 0x07 (Home security) –  
Event inactive (0x00, parameter 0x08)

After the first motion detection, MOTION_BEGIN is sent. If continual move-  
ment is detected, MOTION_BEGIN is sent every 1 minute repeatedly. When  
motion ends, MOTION_END is sent 5 seconds after the last motion detec-  
tion.  
Notification to group 3 is sent only when NIGHT\_MODE = ON and MOTION\_  
ENABLE = ON, regardless of LOCAL_DISABLE state.  
All devices in a group should have the same TIME settings in order that they  
switch off at the same time.  
If multichannel association is created the events are sent from motion sensor  
endpoint.

Association group 3 supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Sensor: Luminescence

Ambient light
Ambient Light via Group 4 is intended to substitute locally measured LUX  
values in target devices – so that the network can have one source of ambi-  
ent light value. Frames are sent a maximum of once per 2.5 minutes and a  
minimum of once per 15 minutes.  
When device already uses remote Ambient Light value, then this value is also  
retransmitted to group 4.  
All devices in such a group should have the same LIGHT (threshold) settings  
in order that night mode is detected at the same time.  
If multichannel association is created the events are sent from light sensor  
endpoint.

Association group 4 supports 15 nodes.
