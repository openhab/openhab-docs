| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Time | Duration of light after motion detection |
| 2 | Light | Light threshold \[lx\]: |
| 5 | Sensitivity | Motion Radar Sensitivity \[%\] |
| 8 | Global_Light | external ambient light value |
| 9 | SLAVE_MODE | Disable local control |

|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Time

Duration of light after motion detection

Values in the range 5 to 900 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Light

Light threshold \[lx\]:
0 – run Learn ambient light sequence.  
2000 – is used as daylight (always night mode).  
Value can be controlled via potentiometer (if present on device) –  
potentiometer value is then used as the default value and any  
potentiometer movement rewrites the current setting.
Values in the range 0 to 2000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2000```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Sensitivity

Motion Radar Sensitivity \[%\]
Value can be controlled via potentiometer (if present on device) – potentiom-  
eter value is then used as the default value and any potentiometer movement  
rewrites the current setting.
Values in the range 2 to 100 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```100```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: Global_Light

external ambient light value
When GLOBAL\_LIGHT mode is ON – device overrides its own light sensor  
values and uses Light Report values from any Z-Wave light sensor instead –  
this has to be configured appropriately to send light automatically.  
If the last remote light level value is older than 30 minutes, the internal light  
value is used again until the next external value is received.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: SLAVE_MODE

Disable local control
"Stupid" mode (bit 2 = 1):  
\- has higher priority then slave mode  
\- lamp/relay is permanently on (for simple power wall switch controlling)

Slave mode (bit 0 =1):  
\- only if included in Z-Wave network  
\- useful for controlling via third-party sensor  
\- lamp/relay is directly controlled via Z-Wave, internal sensors are not used  
for controlling it

Central unit checking (bit 1 =1): (useful especially for controlling via gateway)  
When slave bit is 0:  
\- device signalises fail of lifeline connection (if this bit is zero, fail of lifeline  
connection is not signalised)

When slave bit is 1:  
\- device checks presence of Z-Wave device in lifeline group (gateway).  
If it is not present for 2 minutes (testing repeatedly every 30 seconds)  
device switches to normal mode in the same way as after the end of  
local disabled mode (ON\_BEHAVIOUR)  
\- the device checks every 1 minute for recovery of lifeline connection  
\- if no lifeline specified - it works in normal mode

Do not use button for lamp switching (bit 6 = 1): only for STOGGLE variant  
\- disables button controlling device itself along with controlling group 5.  
When enabled also works in stand-alone.

Be careful with this option, device stops using its own motion sensor in  
Slave and "Stupid" mode.

Values in the range 0 to 4 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: (OFF_BEHAVIOUR)

Off behaviour (timeout)
Behaviour after BASIC OFF (and similar commands).  
If a transition (even with zero change) with a non-default duration is to be pro-  
cessed, the transition cannot be interrupted by any motion event in any case.

0 = Lamp/Relay is switched off and remains so until any new motion  
event (local or remote) is received.

1 - 209 = Lamp/Relay is switched off and remains so until after a specified  
timeout once a new motion event (local or remote) is received.  
Timeout:  
1..100 – 1 second (1) to 100 seconds (100) in 1-second resolution  
101..200 – 1 minute (101) to 100 minutes (200) 1-minute resolution  
201..209 – 1 hour (201) to 9 hours (209) in 1-hour resolution

210 - 254 = Reserved

255 = Lamp/relay is switched off for TIME (cfg 1). It does not wait for a  
motion event and works normally via current motion evaluation.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: ON_BEHAVIOUR

On behaviour (timeout)
Behaviour after BASIC ON (and similar commands).  
If a transition (even with zero change) with a non-default duration is to be  
processed, the transition cannot be interrupted by any motion event in any  
case.

0 = Lamp/relay is switched on and remains so until any new motion  
event (local or remote) is received. It then works normally via current  
motion evaluation.  
Notice – during the day, this mode cannot be ended remotely due  
to motion events not being transmitted – only via local motion sen-  
sor if enabled.

1 - 209 = Lamp/relay is switched on and remains so until after a specified  
timeout once a new motion event (local or remote) is received. It then  
works normally via current motion evaluation.  
Timeout:  
1..100 – 1 second (1) to 100 seconds (100) in 1-second resolution  
101..200 – 1 minute (101) to 100 minutes (200) in 1-minute resolution  
201..209 – 1 hour (201) to 9 hours (209) in 1-hour resolution  
Notice – during the day, this mode cannot be ended remotely due to  
motion events not being transmitted – only via local motion sensor if  
enabled.

210 - 254 = Reserved

255 = Lamp/relay is switched on for TIME (cfg 1). It does not wait for a  
motion event and works normally via current motion evaluation.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 12: ON_TIME_OVER

On behaviour time over (timeout)
Time limit to stop waiting for motion after timeout of ON\_BEHAVIOUR or  
OFF\_ON\_BEHAVIOUR (0-209) to prevent staying ON forever when there is  
no motion.

0 = No additional waiting for motion.

1 - 209 = 1..100 – 1 second (1) to 100 seconds (100) in 1-second resolution  
 101..200 – 1 minute (101) to 100 minutes (200) in 1-minute resolution  
 201..209 – 1 hour (201) to 9 hours (209) in 1-hour resolution

210 - 254 = Reserved

255 = Never stop waiting for motion.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```204```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: ON_OFF_ BEHAVIOUR

Sequence On-Off behaviour (timeout)
Behaviour after a rapid sequence of BASIC ON and BASIC OFF commands.  
The intention is to use a much longer timeout value than the time after a  
single ON command which should then be followed by a short timeout value.  
The behaviour is the same as for parameter 10 (OFF\_LOCAL\_DISABLE)  
except: 255 – device ignores ON - OFF sequence and uses OFF behaviour.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```204```.

The intention is to use a much longer timeout value than the time after a sin-  
gle OFF command which should then be followed by a short timeout value.  
The behaviour is the same as for parameter 11 (ON\_LOCAL\_DISABLE)  
except: 255 – device ignores OFF - ON sequence and uses ON behaviour.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```204```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: SEQUENCE_ TIME

Sequence timing
Time in \[100 milliseconds\] of maximum delay between BASIC ON and BASIC  
OFF (and vice versa) to consider this as a sequence. It is typically 1 second,  
but can be exceptionally longer due to retransmissions and overload – in this  
case, a longer interval can be allowed (up to 5 seconds).
Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 16: MOTION_ DISABLE

Motion Off behaviour (timeout)
Motion disable timeout after BASIC SET to motion endpoint when the inter-  
nal motion sensor is not used for evaluating the behaviour of the lamp (SLAMP)  
relay (SPIR) and groups 2 and 3. Events are, however, still transmitted to the  
Lifeline, and the device can be controlled via remote motion sensors.

0 = BASIC SET to motion sensor endpoint ignored, BASIC to root is  
mapped to relay endpoint, (SPIR) motion sensor still enabled

  
1 - 209 = Internal motion sensor is disabled for specified timeout after BASIC  
SET 0x00 to motion endpoint.  
Timeout:  
1..100 – 1 second (1) to 100 seconds (100) in 1-second resolution  
101..200 – 1 minute (101) to 100 minutes (200) in 1-minute resolution
