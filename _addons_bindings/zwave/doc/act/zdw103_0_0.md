The ZDW103 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

This Wall Mounted Dimmer Receiver can be easily installed to directly or remotely control the on/off and dimming of any connected incandescent lighting or control a motorized window shade or blind. Three way control is possible with an AS101 auxiliary switch

### Inclusion Information

Tap either the top or bottom of the switch paddle on the ZDW103 once

### Exclusion Information

Tap either the top or bottom of the switch paddle on the ZDW103 once

### General Usage Information

Local Control

From the front paddle switch, the ZDW103 allows the user to do the following:

  * Turn ON or OFF, DIM or BRIGHTEN, the load attached.
  * Include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave network.
  * Configure to Control Shades or Window Coverings via Z-Wave network.
  * Control other Z-Wave enabled devices. Also, when a controller prompts you to “Send Node ID” or to “Press Button on Unit”, quickly tap the top or bottom of the switch once to satisfy those instructions.
  * Tapping top of the switch turns the load attached ON.
  * Tapping bottom of the switch turns the load attached OFF.
  * Pressing and holding the top of the paddle switch will brighten the load attached, and pressing and holding the bottom of the switch will dim the load. When OFF, pressing and holding the bottom of the switch will cause the load will go to the minimum dim level.

Note: Upon restoration of power after a power loss, the ZDW103 returns to previous known state.

### Parameter 1: Set Ignore Start Level Bit For Dim 

Defines the behavior when transmitting dim commands
The ZDW103 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. To clear this bit, configure this parameter to the value of 0.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Use transmisison start level |
| 1 | Ignore transmisison start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore transmisison start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmission of command to Group 4
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “un-associating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZDW103 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.  
It is possible that you may only want the units in Group 4 to track when the dimmer is being turned ON and OFF and not when dimming.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Enable transmission to Group 4 |
| 1 | Disable transmission to Group 4 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Enable transmission to Group 4).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

Defines the behavior of the blue LED.
Default is Night Light mode where LED is on when switch is off.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED on when switch is ON |
| 1 | LED on when switch is OFF |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LED on when switch is ON).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON.
Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Ignore Start-Level (Receiving)

This dimmer will start dimming from its current level.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Don’t Send Level Command After Dim

Change behavior of dim level information update
When you press and hold the bottom of the ZDW103 paddle once, the Z-Wave devices that are associated into Group 1 are sent the Dim command. After you release the paddle, the ZDW103 follows up by commanding the devices to go to the same level of the ZDW103. By default, the ZDW103 is set not to do this. To enable ZDW103 to do this set this parameter to 0.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Send level command |
| 1 | Don’t send level command |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Don’t send level command).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: On/Off Command Dim Step

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDW103 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Tap once

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Tap twice

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Tap three time

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Group to update transmitter or controler

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
