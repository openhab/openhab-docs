### Parameter 1: Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands

Defines the behavior when transmitting dim commands
The ZDW120 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. To clear this bit, configure this parameter to the value of 0.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Use transmisison start level |
| 1 | Ignore transmisison start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore transmisison start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmission of command to Group 4
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “un-associating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZDW120 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.  
It is possible that you may only want the units in Group 4 to track when the dimmer is being turned ON and OFF and not when dimming.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Enable transmission to Group 4 |
| 1 | Disable transmission to Group 4 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Enable transmission to Group 4).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

Defines the behavior of the blue LED.
Default is Night Light mode where LED is on when switch is off.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED on when switch is OFF |
| 1 | LED on when switch is ON |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LED on when switch is OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch to ON.
Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Ignore Start-Level (Receiving)

This dimmer will start dimming from its current level.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No |
| 1 | Yes |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (No).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Don’t Send Level Command After Transmitting Dim Commands

Change behavior of dim level information update
When you press and hold the bottom of the ZDW120 paddle once, the Z-Wave devices that are associated into Group 1 are sent the Dim command. After you release the paddle, the ZDW120 follows up by commanding the devices to go to the same level of the ZDW120. By default, the ZDW120 is set not to do this. To enable ZDW120 to do this set this parameter to 0.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Send level command |
| 1 | Don’t send level command |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Don’t send level command).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: On/Off Command Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.

Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: On/Off Command Dim Rate

Sets the rate at which the dimmer changes the light level.
This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then every 10ms the dim level will change. If you set it to 255, then every 2.55 seconds
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Local Control Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.

Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then every 10ms the dim level will change. If you set it to 255, then every 2.55 seconds the dimmer will change.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_10_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 11: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Step

Indicates how many levels the dimmer will change for each dimming step.

Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_11_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 12: ALL ON/ALL OFF Dim Rate

Sets the dim rate for the all on/off command
This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then every 10ms the dim level will change. If you set it to 255, then every 2.55 seconds the dimmer will change.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 13: Disable Group 4 During a Dim Command

Change behavior of command to Group 4 during Dim Command
After the ZDW120 is commanded to stop dimming, it will then command the Z-Wave devices in Group 4 to the ZDW120’s new level. To prevent the ZDW120 from commanding the Z-Wave devices in Group 4 during this particular occurrence, set Parameter 13 to the value of 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Enable transmission to Group 4 |
| 1 | Disable transmission to Group 4 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Enable transmission to Group 4).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 19: LED Transmission Indication

Change behavior of LED during transmission to group 1-4
The ZDW120 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZDW120 is set to flicker for only 1 second.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No flicker |
| 1 | Flicker during all transmission |
| 2 | Flicker first second of transmission |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (Flicker first second of transmission).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZDW120 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Tap once
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Tap twice
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Tap three time
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Group to update transmitter or controler
This group supports 5 nodes.
