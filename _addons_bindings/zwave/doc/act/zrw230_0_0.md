The ZRW230 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

**ZRW230 WALL MOUNTED SWITCH**

The ZRW230 Wall Mounted 3-Way Switch is a component of the HomePro lighting control system.

This Wall Mounted Switch is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.

As part of a Z-Wave network, the ZRW230 will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.

There are no field repairable assemblies on this unit.. If service is needed, the unit must be returned where purchased.

### Inclusion Information

**Including to the Network (Must be installed in its permanent location, not on test bench)**

2\. Tap either the top or bottom of the switch once

### Exclusion Information

**Excluding from the Network**

1\. Setup the controller you are using to exclude a device from the network.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 7 configuration parameters available in the ZRW230.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Set Ignore Start Level Bit | Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands |
| 2 | Suspend Group 4 | Stop transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4 |
| 3 | Night Light | LED behaviour of the ZRW230 switch |
| 4 | Invert Switch | Switch (paddle) behaviour. |
| 14 | Enable Shade Control Group 2 | The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 2 |
| 15 | Enable Shade Control Group 3 | The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 3 |
| 19 | LED Transmission Indication | LED Transmission Indication |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Set Ignore Start Level Bit

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands
The ZRW230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. If this bit is set to 0, the dimmer will not ignore the start level.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Dimmer will not ignore the start level |
| 1 | Dimmer will ignore the start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Dimmer will ignore the start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Suspend Group 4

Stop transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZRW230 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Enable transmitting to devices “associated” into Group 4 |
| 1 | Stop transmitting to devices “associated” into Group 4 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Enable transmitting to devices “associated” into Group 4).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

LED behaviour of the ZRW230 switch
The LED on the ZRW230 will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turned ON. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned OFF instead, set parameter 3 to a value of 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Turn LED ON when the load is turned ON |
| 1 | Turn LED ON when the load is turned OFF |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Turn LED ON when the load is turned ON).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Switch (paddle) behaviour.
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON , set parameter 4 to 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Top of switch is ON, bottom is OFF |
| 1 | Top of switch is OFF, bottom is ON |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Top of switch is ON, bottom is OFF).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 14: Enable Shade Control Group 2

The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 2
The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 2 if this configuration parameter is set to 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable operation of shade control devices via group 2 |
| 1 | Enable operation of shade control devices via group 2 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable operation of shade control devices via group 2).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: Enable Shade Control Group 3

The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 3
The ZRW230 can operate shade control devices via its group 3 if this configuration parameter is set to 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable operation of shade control devices via group 3 |
| 1 | Enable operation of shade control devices via group 3 |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable operation of shade control devices via group 3).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 19: LED Transmission Indication

LED Transmission Indication
The ZRW230 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZRW230 is set to flicker for only 1 second.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED will not flicker |
| 1 | LED will flicker the entire time while transmitting |
| 2 | LED will flicker 1 second when it begins transmitting |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (LED will flicker 1 second when it begins transmitting).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZRW230 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Tapping paddle once


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Tapping paddle twice


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Tapping paddle three times


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: By command to the ZRW230


This group supports 5 nodes.
