The ZTM230 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The ZTM230 Wall Mounted Transmitter is a component of the HomePro lighting control system. Wire the Transmitter anywhere power is available according to the diagram above and program from the Wireless Controller to operate loads. Inclusion of the ZTM230 Wall Mounted Transmitter on the ZTH200 Wireless Controller menu allows remote ON/OFF control and dimming of lights controlled by associated modules, as it does not control any electrical load directly.

This Wall Mounted Transmitter is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be Included in the network and will also act as repeaters to increase the range of the network.

### Inclusion Information

Including to the Network (Must be installed in its permanent location, not on test bench)  
1\. Setup the controller you are using to include the device into the network.  
2\. Tap the top or bottom of the left switch once

### Exclusion Information

1\. Setup the controller you are using to exclude a device from the network.  
2\. Tap the top or the bottom of the left switch once.

### Parameter 1: Ignore Start Level Bit

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands
The ZTM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command can be sent so that the dimmer ignores the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. By default, the ZTM230 sends the command so that the dimmer will start dimming from its current dim level rather then the start level embedded in the command. To change this, simply set the configuration parameter above to 0.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not ignore start level |
| 1 | Ignore start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmitting commands to group 4 devices.
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group.  
Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZTM230 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

LED behaviour of the ZTM230.
The LED on the ZTM230, will by default, turn ON when the status of the devices in Group 1 is ON. To make the LED turn ON when the status of Group 1 is OFF set this parameter to a value of 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Switch paddle behaviour
To change the top of the transmitter to OFF and the bottom of the transmitter to ON, set parameter 4 to 1. To change back to original settings, set this parameter to the value of 0.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Ignore Start Level Bit

Ignore Start Level When Receiving Dim Commands
The ZTM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command can be sent so that the dimmer ignores the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. By default, the ZTM230 sends the command so that the dimmer will start dimming from its current dim level rather then the start level embedded in the command. To change this, simply set the configuration parameter above to 0

**Note that this only affects a level that is reported or possibly sent by the ZTM230 since the ZTM230 does not control a load.**
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: On/Off Command dim step

Dim step parameter
Dim step (dim rate) parameter. It can be set to a value of 1 to 99. This value indicates how many levels the dimmer will change when the timer (discussed below) expires.
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: On/Off Command dim timer

Dim timer parameter
Dim timer parameter (how fast the dim rate) parameter. It can be set to a value of 1 to 255. This value indicates in 10 millisecond resolution, how often the dim level will change. For example, if you set this parameter to 1, then the dim level will change every 10mS. If you set it to 255, then the dim level will change every 2.55 seconds.
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

Note that this only affects a level that is reported or possibly sent by the ZTM230 since the ZTM230 does not control a load.  
  
After the ZTM230 is commanded to stop dimming when it has been dimming because of the DIM START command, it will then command the Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 to its new level. To prevent the ZTM230 from commanding the Z-Wave devices in Group 4 during this particular occurrence, set Parameter 13 to the value of 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The ZTM230 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to not flicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZTM230 is set to flicker for only 1 second.
Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 20: Poll group 1 interval

Group 1 poll interval
How often it will poll Group 1 is configured using this parameter 20. The default poll rate is 2. Note that the poll interval starts timing again upon successful transmission of the poll request. Also note that the polling interval is not “exact” and that you may see some slight drift occur. Also the poll interval is reset upon switch being pressed.

Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_22_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode
