### Parameter 1: Ignore Transmitting Start Level Bit

Set Ignore Start Level Bit When Transmitting Dim Commands
The ZTM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command can be sent so that the dimmer ignores the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. By default, the ZTM230 sends the command so that the dimmer will start dimming from its current dim level rather then the start level embedded in the command. To change this, simply set the configuration parameter above to 0.  
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Do not ignore start level |
| 1 | Ignore start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmitting commands to group 4 devices.
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group.  
Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZTM230 from transmitting to devices that are “associated” into Group 4  
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Ignore Receiving Start Level Bit

Ignore Start Level When Receiving Dim Commands
The ZTM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command can be sent so that the dimmer ignores the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. By default, the ZTM230 sends the command so that the dimmer will start dimming from its current dim level rather then the start level embedded in the command. To change this, simply set the configuration parameter above to 0

**Note that this only affects a level that is reported or possibly sent by the ZTM230 since the ZTM230 does not control a load.**
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZTM230 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Group 1 left paddle
Nodes in this group are turned ON and OFF by tapping the top or bottom of the left switch.  
Nodes associated into this group are dimmed by pressing and holding the bottom of the left switch until the desired dim level is reached.  

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2 right paddle
Nodes in this group are turned ON and OFF by tapping the right switch.  
Nodes associated into this group are dimmed by pressing and holding the bottom of the right switch until the desired dim level is reached. The LED on the right switch will indicate the status of group 2. Group 2 will be polled at a specific interval and the status of group 2 will be indicated via the LED. The polling interval can be configured.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Group 3

Group 3 double tap right paddle
Nodes in this group are turned ON and OFF by tapping the right switch twice. Nodes associated into this group are dimmed by tapping the bottom of the switch once and then pressing and holding the bottom of the switch until the desired dim level is reached.  


note that associating nodes into group 3 will cause a very slight delay before the command is transmitted to group 2.  

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Group 4

Group 4
Nodes in this group are turned ON or OFF or set to a specific dim level when the ZTM230 is controlled remotely. You can place up to 5 nodes in each group.  
If controlling dimmers, for best results, associate the dimmers into the group first.  

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
