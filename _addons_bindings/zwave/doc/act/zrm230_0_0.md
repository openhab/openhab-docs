The ZRM230 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Radio Frequency Controlled, 6A, 230 VAC, European Wall Mounted 3-Way Switch, Dual Switch, Release 1.1

The ZRM230 Wall Mounted 3-Way Switch is a component of the HomePro lighting control system. This Wall Mounted Switch is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 9 configuration parameters available in the ZRM230.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Ignore start level | Set ignore start level bit when transmitting dim commands. |
| 2 | Suspend Group 4 | Disable transmitting commands to group 4 devices. |
| 3 | Night Light | LED behaviour of the ZRM230. |
| 4 | Invert Switch | Switch (paddle) behaviour. |
| 14 | Enable Shade Control Group 2 | Operate shade control devices on group 2. |
| 15 | Enable Shade Control Group 3 | Operate shade control devices on group 3. |
| 19 | LED Transmission Indication | Z-Wave transmission LED settings. |
| 20 | Poll Group 2 Interval | Poll Group 2 interval (minutes). |
| 22 | Poll Group 2 | Group 2 poll control. |

### Parameter 1: Ignore start level

Set ignore start level bit when transmitting dim commands.
The ZRM230 can send Dim commands to Z-Wave enabled dimmers. The Dim command has a start level embedded in it. A dimmer receiving this command will start dimming from that start level. However, the command also has a bit that indicates whether the dimmer should ignore the start level. If the bit is set to 1, the dimmer will ignore the start level and instead start dimming from its current level. If this bit is set to 0, the dimmer will ignore the start level.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Ignore start level |
| 1 | Do not ignore start level |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Do not ignore start level).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Suspend Group 4

Disable transmitting commands to group 4 devices.
You may wish to disable transmitting commands to Z-Wave devices that are in Group 4 without “disassociating” those devices from the group. Setting parameter 2 to the value of 1 will stop the ZRM230 from transmitting todevices that are “associated” into Group 4.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Transmit to group 4 devices |
| 1 | Stop transmit to group 4 devices |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Transmit to group 4 devices).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Night Light

LED behaviour of the ZRM230.
The LED on the ZRM230 will by default, turn ON when the load attached is turned ON. To make the LED turn ON when the load attached is turned OFF instead, set parameter 3 to a value of 1.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Led when load on |
| 1 | Led when load off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Led when load on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Invert Switch

Switch (paddle) behaviour.
To change the top of the switch to OFF and the bottom of the switch ON , set parameter 4 to 1. Note: If you invert the switches and also install the product upside down, remember the load will now be controlled by the right, not the left switch.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Invert off |
| 1 | Invert on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Invert off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 14: Enable Shade Control Group 2

Operate shade control devices on group 2.
The ZRM230 can operate shade control devices via its group 2 if this configuration parameter is set to 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: Enable Shade Control Group 3

Operate shade control devices on group 3.
The ZRM230 can operate shade control devices via its group 3 if this configuration parameter is set to 1.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 19: LED Transmission Indication

Z-Wave transmission LED settings.
The ZRM230 will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 4 groups. This flickering can be set to notflicker at all (set to 0), to flicker the entire time it is transmitting (set to 1), or to flicker for only 1 second when it begins transmitting (set to 2). By default, the ZRM230 is set to flicker for only 1 second.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | No flicker |
| 1 | Flicker for 1 second |
| 2 | Flicker for 2 second |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (Flicker for 2 second).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_19_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 20: Poll Group 2 Interval

Poll Group 2 interval (minutes).
Poll Group 2 Interval (minutes), valid values = 1 through 255 (Default value is 2).
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_20_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 22: Poll Group 2

Group 2 poll control.
Poll Group 2, if value is 1, the ZRM230 will poll group 2 at the interval set in configuration Parameter 20.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_22_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZRM230 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Left paddle (relais)


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Right paddle


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Right double click paddle


This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Controller updates

Group used to inform devices about the updates of the status of the device.
This group supports 5 nodes.
