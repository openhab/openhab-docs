## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 8 configuration parameters available in the 45602.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Ignore Start Level When Receiving Dim Commands |  |
| 7 | Dim Rate Step Count - ZWave Control | Number of steps the dimmer will change when controlling via ZWave |
| 8 | Dim Rate Step Duration - ZWave Control | Timing of each step the dimmer will change when controlling via ZWave |

### Parameter 5: Ignore Start Level When Receiving Dim Commands


Every “Dim” command from your remote controller includes a start level embedded in it. The 45602 can be set to ignore the start level that is part of the dim command. Setting parameter 5 to a value of 0 will cause the 45602 to dim or brighten from the start level embedded in the command
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Respect Start Level |
| 1 | Ignore Start Level (default) |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Ignore Start Level (default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 7: Dim Rate Step Count - ZWave Control

Number of steps the dimmer will change when controlling via ZWave
Dim Rate Adjustments: Both the number of steps (or levels) that the dimmer will change and the timing of the steps can be modified to suit personal preferences. The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_7_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 8: Dim Rate Step Duration - ZWave Control

Timing of each step the dimmer will change when controlling via ZWave
Dim Rate Adjustments: Both the number of steps (or levels) that the dimmer will change and the timing of the steps can be modified to suit personal preferences. The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels
Values in the range 1 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_8_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 9: Dim Rate Step Count - Manual Control

Number of steps the dimmer will change when controlling manually
Dim Rate Adjustments: Both the number of steps (or levels) that the dimmer will change and the timing of the steps can be modified to suit personal preferences. The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels
Values in the range 1 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_9_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 10: Dim Rate Step Duration - manual Control

Timing of each step the dimmer will change when controlling manually

The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is “3”. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels

The manufacturer defined default value is ```3```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_12_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 29: Load Sensing

Sense when existing switch is used to turn on the lamp
Load sensing allows you to operate the lamp using the existing switch on the lamp by sensing a change in the resistive load of the light plugged in. When it detects the change in resistance it will turn the lamp on to full power.

When replacing a burned-out light bulb, the load sensing feature will automatically turn the light ON when the new bulb is installed even if the Z-wave module was previously turned OFF
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled (default) |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disabled (default)).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_29_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
