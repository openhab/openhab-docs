# ZMNHAA Flush 1 relay
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZMNHAA*, manufactured by *[Goap](http://www.qubino.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```qubino_zmnhaa_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZMNHAA supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/205) to improve the documentation.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHAA supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: basic on/off (triggered at change of the output 
Q state and reflecti


This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2:  basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I2 
state and reflect


This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3:  basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I3 
state and reflect


This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 4: Controller Updates


This group supports 1 nodes.
