The ZMNHTD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for energy measurements in single-phase electrical power network and can be used in residential, industrial and utility applications. Meters measure energy directly in 2-wire networks according to the principle of fast sampling of voltage and current signals. A built-in microprocessor calculates energy, power and power factor from the measured signals. The module can be controlled through Z-wave network and it acts as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network. It is designed to be mounted on DIN rail.

Measurements: Voltage V Current I Power – Active W Power – Active total Import kWh Power – Active total Export kWh Power – Reactive var Power – Reactive total kvarh Power – Apparent total kVAh Power Factor PF

It is possible to connect two external relay to Smart Meter module. One controlled by built-in optical (IR) communication port on the side, second controlled by output on terminal 5.

### Inclusion Information

Module Inclusion (Adding to Z-wave network)

- Connect module to power supply
- enable add/remove mode on main controller
- auto-inclusion (works for about 5 seconds after connected to power supply) or
- press service button S for more than 2 second

NOTE: For auto-inclusion procedure, first set main controller into inclusion mode and then connect module to power supply.

### Exclusion Information

Module Exclusion/Reset (Removing from Z-Wave network):

- Connect module to power supply
- bring module within maximum 1 Meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
