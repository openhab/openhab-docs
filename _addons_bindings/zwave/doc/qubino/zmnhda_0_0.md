The ZMNHDA supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for dimming the bulb or to manage the speed of a fan. The module can be controlled either through a Z-Wave network or through the wall switch.   
   
The module is designed to be mounted inside a “flush mounting box” and is hidden behind a traditional wall switch.   
   
Module measures power consumption of bulb or fan and supports connection of digital temperature sensor.

### Inclusion Information

- Connect module to power supply,
- bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
- enable add/remove mode on main controller,
- auto-inclusion (30 minutes after connected to power supply) or
- press service button S for more than 2 seconds or
- press push button I1 three times within 3s (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds).

### Exclusion Information

- Connect module to power supply,
- bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
- enable add/remove mode on main controller,
- press service button S for more than 6 seconds or
- press push button I1 five times within 3s (5 times change switch state within 3 seconds)

By this function all parameters of the module are set to default values and own ID is deleted.

If service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 second module is excluded, but configuration parameters are not set to default values.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHDA supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: multilevel (triggered at changes of state/value of the Flush dimmer)


This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I2 state and reflecting


This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I3 state and reflecting


This group supports 4 nodes.

### Group 4: Controller updates


This group supports 4 nodes.
