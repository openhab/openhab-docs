Treshold time for power reporting \[Watt\]
Set value refers to the time interval with which power consumption in Watts is reported (0 – 32535 seconds). If 300 is entered (by default), energy consumption reports will be sent to the gateway (hub) every 300 seconds (or 5 minutes).

- 0 - Power consumption reporting disabled
- 30 - 32535 = 30 - 32535 seconds. Power consumption reporting enabled. Report is sent according to time interval (value) set here.

The device is reporting the following values (if there was a change): Power \[W\], Voltage \[V\] and Current \[A\]
Values in the range 0 to 32535 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The Smart Plug 16A supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Reserved for communication with main controller
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Status on/off

Send control command BASIC\_SET 0x00/0xFF
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Load dependent 

sending control commands BASIC\_SET 0x00/0xFF depending on current load
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Secure Status On/Off

Send control command BASIC\_SET 0x00/0xFF
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Secure Load dependent 

sending control commands BASIC\_SET 0x00/0xFF depending on current load
This group supports 5 nodes.
