The ZMNHBD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for switching on or off two electrical devices (e.g. lights or fans,..). The module can be controlled either through Z-Wave network or through the wallswitches. The module is designed to be mounted inside a "flush mountingbox", hidden behind a traditional wall switch. Module measures power consumption of two electrical devices and supports connection of digital temperature sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network.

### Inclusion Information

**Module Inclusion (Adding to Z-Wave network)**

- Connect module to power supply (with temperature sensor connected -if purchased)
- Enable add/remove mode on main controller
- Auto-inclusion (works forabout 5 seconds after connected to power supply) or
- Press push button I1 three times within 3s (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds) or
- Press service button **S** (only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 2 seconds.

**NOTE1:** For auto-inclusion procedure, first set main controller into inclusion mode and then connect module to power supply.

**NOTE2:** When connecting temperature sensor to module that has already been included, you have to exclude module first. Switch off power supply , connect the sensor and re-include the module.

### Exclusion Information

**Module Exclusion/Reset (Removing from Z-Wavenetwork)**

- Connect module to power supply
- Bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
- Enable add/remove mode on main controller,
- Press push button **I1** five times within 3s (5 times change switch state within 3 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is connected to the power supply or
- Press service button **S** (only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 6 seconds.

By this function all parameters of the module are set to default values and own ID is deleted.

If push button I1 is pressed three times within 3s (or service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 seconds) module is excluded, but configuration parameters are not set to default values.
