This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: Basic on/off (triggered at change of the input Q 
state and reflectin


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic on/off (triggered at change of the input I2 
state and reflecti


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: Notification report (triggered at change of the input I2 
state and r


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 5: Binary Sensor (triggered at change of the input I2 
state and reflect
