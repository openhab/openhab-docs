The ZMNHLD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used to regulate temperature. Regulation is done using full wave PWM technology. The module can be controlled either through Z-wave network or through the wall switch. The module is designed to be mounted inside a “flush mounting box” and is hidden behind a traditional wall switch. Module measures power consumption of connected device. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network.

### Inclusion Information

WARNING: Service button S **must NOT be used** when module is connected to 110-230V power supply.

- Connect module to power supply (with temperature sensor connected - if purchased),
- Enable add/remove mode on main controller
- Auto-inclusion (works for about 5 seconds after connected to power supply) or
- **110V-230V power supply:** Press push button I1 three times within 3 seconds (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds)
- **24V SELV:** Press service button **S** for more than 2 seconds.

**NOTE1:** For auto-inclusion procedure, first set main controller into inclusion mode and then connect module to power supply.

**NOTE2:** When connecting temperature sensor to module that has already been included, you have to exclude module first. Switch off power supply,connect the sensor and re-include the module.

### Exclusion Information

WARNING: Service button S **must NOT be used** when module is connected to 110-230V power supply.

- Connect module to power supply
- Bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller
- Enable add/remove mode on main controller

- **24V SELV:** Press ervice button **S** for more than 6 seconds.

By this function all parameters of the module are set to default values and own ID is deleted. If push button I1 is pressed three times within 3 seconds (or service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 seconds) module is excluded, but configuration parameters are not set to default values.

NOTE: If the module is included with parameters 100 or 101 with values different to default and module reset is done, wait at least 30s before next inclusion.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZMNHLD supports 9 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

reserved for communication with the main controller
This group supports 1 nodes.

### Group 2: basic on/off (output)

Triggered at change of the output
This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 3: Sensor_multilevel_get


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 4: basic on/off (temp limit)

triggered by Too high temperature limit
This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 5: Thermostat setpoint get


This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 6: basic on/off (window)

triggered by change of I1
This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 7: basic on/off (condense sensor)

triggered by change of I2
This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 8: basic on/off (flood sensor)

triggered by change of I3
This group supports 16 nodes.

### Group 9: sensor multilevel report

Triggered at change of temperature
This group supports 16 nodes.
