# ZMNHAD Flush 1 relay
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZMNHAD*, manufactured by *[Goap](http://www.qubino.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```qubino_zmnhad_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Wall Switch*, defining Any device attached to the wall that controls a binary status of something, for ex. a light switch.

The ZMNHAD supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

This Z-Wave module is used for switching on or off the electrical device (e.g. light or fan). The module can be controlled either through Z-wave network or through the wall switch. The module is designed to be mounted inside a “flush mounting box”, hidden behind a traditional wall switch. Module measures power consumption of electrical device and supports connection of digital temperature sensor. It is designed to act as repeater in order to improve range and stability of Z-wave network. Supported switches Module supports mono-stable switches (push button) and bi-stable switches. The module is factory set to operate with bi-stable switches.

### Inclusion Information

**Module Inclusion (Adding to Z-Wave network)**

- Connect module to power supply (with temperature sensor connected -if purchased)
- Enable add/remove mode on main controller
- Auto-inclusion (works forabout 5 seconds after connected to power supply) or
- Press push button I1 three times within 3s (3 times change switch state within 3 seconds) or
- Press service button **S** (only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 2 seconds.

**NOTE1:** For auto-inclusion procedure, first set main controller into inclusion mode and then connect module to power supply.

**NOTE2:** When connecting temperature sensor to module that has already been included, you have to exclude module first. Switch off power supply , connect the sensor and re-include the module.

### Exclusion Information

**Module Exclusion/Reset (Removing from Z-Wavenetwork)**

- Connect module to power supply
- Bring module within maximum 1 meter (3 feet) of the main controller,
- Enable add/remove mode on main controller,
- Press push button **I1** five times within 3s (5 times change switch state within 3 seconds) in the first 60 seconds after the module is connected to the power supply or
- Press service button **S** (only applicable for 24 V SELV supply voltage) for more than 6 seconds.

By this function all parameters of the module are set to default values and own ID is deleted.

If push button I1 is pressed three times within 3s (or service button S is pressed more than 2 and less than 6 seconds) module is excluded, but configuration parameters are not set to default values.
