The BVSZWE01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The BVS (Ball Valve Servo) is a motor to retrofit existing and installed ball valves into smart water controlling devices. Its wireless communication capabilities are compatible with several industry standards (Lora, Z-Wave, ULE) for easy integration into existing networks. The motor is powered by a 12 V external power supply or - optional – a battery block.

The variable clamps allow mounting even in complex pipe installations. The patented motor coupling ensures easy installation and precise long-term operation. The device can operate in difficult environmental conditions, even submerged under water and allows to directly connect one additional local water sensor pad by cable.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The BVSZWE01 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Lifeline. All alarms that shall be sent to the gateway

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Switch on operate

Switch Devices when Water Valve is operated (either local or by sensor o by wireless command)

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Switch on leak

Switch Devices when water leak was detected

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Switch on temperature too high

Switch Devices when temperature raise above threshold

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Switch on temperature too low

Switch Devices when temperature falls below threshold

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
