# DWS01 Door and Window Sensor
This describes the Z-Wave device *DWS01*, manufactured by *[Hank](http://www.hank-tech.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```hank_dws01_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The DWS01 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

Sensor detects when a door is open or closed, also has a tamper switch.

### Inclusion Information

Non-secure: press the Z-button three times rapidly.

Secure: hold the Z-button for three seconds.

### Exclusion Information

Press the Z-button three times rapidly.

### Wakeup Information

The DWS01 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Separate the magnet from the sensor body or pull the cover back and press the little button near the tamper switch until the little blue LED illuminates.

### General Usage Information

Unit is labeled with HKZW-DWS01, but also sold as "MONOPRICE Door and Window Sensor P/N 24259"

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the DWS01 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Door sensor | sensor_door | sensor_door | Door | Contact | 
| Tamper alarm | alarm_tamper | alarm_tamper |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Door sensor
Indicates if the door/window is open or closed.

The ```sensor_door``` channel is of type ```sensor_door``` and supports the ```Contact``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Contact``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OPEN | Open |
| CLOSED | Closed |

### Tamper alarm
Indicates if the tamper alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_tamper``` channel is of type ```alarm_tamper``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the DWS01.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 14 | Enable / disable BASIC SET | Enable basic set reporting to group 2 |
| 15 | Value of BASIC SET | Value to send for BASIC SET |
| 32 | Level for Low Battery Alarm | Adjust the percent of battery left before a low battery level alarm is sent |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 14: Enable / disable BASIC SET

Enable basic set reporting to group 2

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disable BASIC SET |
| 1 | Enable basic set |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Disable BASIC SET).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_14_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 15: Value of BASIC SET

Value to send for BASIC SET

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Send 255 when open |
| 1 | Send 0 when open |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Send 255 when open).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_15_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 32: Level for Low Battery Alarm

Adjust the percent of battery left before a low battery level alarm is sent

Values in the range 10 to 50 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```20```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_32_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The DWS01 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Association Group 1
  * Group 1 reports the status of the Door/Window Sensor, the battery level, and the tamper button status. 

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Association Group 2
  * Group 2 is assigned to the Door/Window Sensor BASIC SET command. 

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
