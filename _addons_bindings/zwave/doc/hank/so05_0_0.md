The HKZW-SO05 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Smart plug is a Z-Wave Switch plugin module specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) of any plug-in tool. It can report wattage consumption or kWh energy usage. Smart Plug is also a security Z-Wave device and supports the Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.

HKZW-SO05 is a Smart Plug based on Z-Wave plus specification

The features list:

1\) Supports 1xAC output and 2xUSB outputs;

2\) AC output switch on/off by manual or Z-Wave command;

3\) RGB LED indicates the Z-Wave network range;

4\) RGB LED indicates the load power;

5\) Z-Wave plus compatible (500 serials product);

6\) supporting power meter;

7\) supporting repeater role;

Supporting firmware OTA;
