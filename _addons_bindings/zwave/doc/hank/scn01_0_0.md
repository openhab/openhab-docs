The SCN01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SCN01 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour. The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

There are no available settings to set up the wake up time.

Pressing and holding the Z-Button for 3 seconds. The led will turn to green, which means Scene Controller has successfully sent the wake up notification out.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SCN01 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters configured.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SCN01 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

Sends associated devices central scene notification command and battery report command.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control

Sends basic set command to associated devices.
This group supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimming Control

Sends switch multilevel set, multilevel start level change and multilevel stop level change to associated devices.
This group supports 5 nodes.
