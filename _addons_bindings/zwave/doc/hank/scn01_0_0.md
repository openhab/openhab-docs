# SCN01 One-key Scene Controller
This describes the Z-Wave device *SCN01*, manufactured by *[Hank](http://www.hank-tech.com/)* with the thing type UID of ```hank_scn01_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Remote Control*, defining Any portable or hand-held device that controls the status of something, e.g. remote control, keyfob etc..

The SCN01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The SCN01 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Scene Controller is a slave product that is wireless, portable and rechargeable. It can control a Z-Wave device, such as smart plug, smart dimmer through a Z-Wave gateway. You can also activate a scene like sleep scene, movie scene and entertainment scene with it.

### Inclusion Information

### Include as a non-secure device

  1. Set the Z-Wave controller into include mode.
  2. Triple click the Z-button.
  3. If the inclusion is successful, the LED will blink blue for 5 seconds and then remain solid for 15 seconds.

### Include as a secure device

  1. Set the Z-Wave controller into include mode.
  2. Press and hold the Z-button for 3 seconds.
  3. If the inclusion is successful, the LED will blink green for 5 seconds and then remain solid for 15 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Set the Z-Wave controller into exclude mode.
  2. Triple click the Z-button.
  3. If the exclusion is successful, the LED will blink orange for 5 seconds and then remain solid for 3 seconds.

### Wakeup Information

The SCN01 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


There are no available settings to set up the wake up time. 

Press and hold the Z-Button for 3 seconds. The led will turn to green, which means the scene controller has successfully sent the wake up notification out.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the SCN01 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Scene Number | scene_number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Scene Number
Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel is of type ```scene_number``` and supports the ```Number``` item.
This channel provides the scene, and the event as a decimal value in the form ```<scene>.<event>```. The scene number is set by the device, and the event is as follows -:

| Event ID | Event Description  |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | Single key press   |
| 1        | Key released       |
| 2        | Key held down      |
| 3        | Double keypress    |
| 4        | Tripple keypress   |
| 5        | 4 x keypress       |
| 6        | 5 x keypress       |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the SCN01.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 42 | Duration | Set the duration value of the sent commands |
| 254 | Configuration Lock | Lock/unlock all configuration parameters. |
| 255 | Reset/remove | Reset the sensor or remove from the Z-Wave network |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 42: Duration

Set the duration value of the sent commands
Setting the duration value of the sent commands, switch multilevel Set and switch multilevel start level change.
Values in the range 0 to 255 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```255```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_42_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 254: Configuration Lock

Lock/unlock all configuration parameters.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Unlock |
| 1 | Lock |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Unlock).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_254_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 255: Reset/remove

Reset the sensor or remove from the Z-Wave network

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 85 | Factory Reset without Remove |
| 1431655765 | Factory Reset & Remove |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The SCN01 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Sends associated devices central scene notification command and battery report command.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control

Sends basic set command to associated devices.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Dimming Control

Sends switch multilevel set, multilevel start level change and multilevel stop level change to associated devices.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
