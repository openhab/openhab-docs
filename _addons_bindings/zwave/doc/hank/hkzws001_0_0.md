## Overview

Hank Smart Plug is a Z-Wave Switch plugin module specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (On/Off) of any plug-in tool. It can report wattage consumption or kWh energy usage. Smart Plug is also a security Z-Wave device and supports Over The Air (OTA) feature for the product's firmware upgrade.

Based on the Z-Wave Plus specification.

Features List:

1. Supports 1xAC output and 2xUSB outputs;
2. AC output switch on/off by manual or Z-Wave command;
3. LED indicates the working status;
4. Z-Wave plus compatible (500 serials Product);
5. Supporting power meter;
6. Supporting repeater role
7. Supporting firmware OTA

### Inclusion Information

Manual Z-Wave network inclusion:

(1) Connect the power supply.

(2) Set the Z-Wave network main controller into learning mode (see Z-Wave network controller operating manual).
