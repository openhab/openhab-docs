The StellaZ supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The StellaZ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

StellaZ is a wireless Thermostat Valve Control capable controlling heating, air ventilation and climate control units. Sensors, control and actuator are combined in one single device allowing stand alone energy efficient room control.

The device can run in four different operation modes (Off, Energy Saving, Comfort, Direct Control) to control the temperature. The room temperature can also be reported by the device. Open windows will be recognized and lead to a lower control temperature for 20 minutes to prevent waste of energy.

### Inclusion Information

Pushing the button behind the round hole in the enclosure for 5 seconds will confirm inclusion of the device.

### Exclusion Information

Pushing the button behind the round hole in the enclosure for 5 seconds will confirm exclusion of the device.

### Wakeup Information

The StellaZ does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


A single click on button behind the round hole in the enclosure wakes up the device when sleeping.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the StellaZ -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature | Temperature | Number:Temperature | 
| Thermostat mode | thermostat_mode | thermostat_mode | Temperature | Number | 
| Setpoint (furnace) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint | Heating | Number:Temperature | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Thermostat mode
Sets the thermostat.

The ```thermostat_mode``` channel is of type ```thermostat_mode``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Number``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Off |
| 1 | Heat |
| 2 | Cool |
| 3 | Auto |
| 4 | Aux Heat |
| 5 | Resume |
| 6 | Fan Only |
| 7 | Furnace |
| 8 | Dry Air |
| 9 | Moist Air |
| 10 | Auto Changeover |
| 11 | Heat Economy |
| 12 | Cool Economy |
| 13 | Away |

### Setpoint (furnace)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Setpoint (heating)
Sets the thermostat setpoint.

The ```thermostat_setpoint``` channel is of type ```thermostat_setpoint``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Heating``` category.

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.
