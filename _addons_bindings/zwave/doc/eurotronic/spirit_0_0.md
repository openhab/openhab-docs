The Spirit supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Spirit Z-Wave Plus is a Z-Wave radio standard compatible energy-saving radiator thermostat.

FLiRS (Frequently Listening Receiver Slave): Spirit Z-Wave uses FLiRS to provide short latency and short responding times.

### Inclusion Information

Start Inclusion mode of your primary Z-Wave Controller. Press the Boost-Button. Spirit Z-Wave Plus will show the assigned NodeID.

### Exclusion Information

Start Exclusion mode of your primary Z-Wave Controller. Now press and hold the boost button of the Spirit Z-Wave Plus for at least 5 seconds.
