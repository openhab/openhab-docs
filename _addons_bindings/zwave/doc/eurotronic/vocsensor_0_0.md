  * Returns the following values:
      * VOC value (volatile organic compounds) in ppm
      * CO2 value (as CO2 equivalent) in ppm
      * Temperature (°C) and humidity (%)
      * Dew point (°C)
  * Supports Z-Wave Plus S2 security (encryption)
  * Z-Wave repeater function
  * Operation with plug-in power supply unit

### Inclusion Information

Press the back button three times within 1 second.

While the inclusion is active, the LED is blinking green. If the inclusion was successful the green LED will light up for 5 seconds. Otherwise the red led will light up for 5 seconds to indicate failure.

### Exclusion Information

Press the back button three times within 1 second.

While the exclusion is active, the LED is blinking green. If the exclusion was successful the green LED will light up for 5 seconds. Otherwise the red led will light up for 5 seconds to indicate failure.

### General Usage Information

On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network Air Quality Sensor Z-Wave Plus needs to be added to an existing wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network.

This process is called Inclusion.

Air Quality Sensor Z-Wave Plus can also be removed from a network.

This process is called Exclusion.

Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network.

This controller is turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode.

Please consult the manual of your Z-Wave Controller how to activate Inclusion or Exclusion mode.

If Air Quality Sensor Z-Wave Plus has been added to a network, it has to be removed prior to be added to another wireless network.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The VOC-SENSOR supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Air Quality Sensor Z-Wave Plus can be associated with other devices.
Commands:

DEVICE\_RESET\_LOCALLY\_NOTIFICATION,NOTIFICATION\_REPORT,SENSOR\_MULTILEVEL\_REPORT

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Temperature

Air Quality Sensor Z-Wave Plus can be associated with other devices.
Command: SENSOR\_MULTILEVEL\_REPORT

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
