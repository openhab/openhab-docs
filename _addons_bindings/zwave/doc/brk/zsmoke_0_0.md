# ZSMOKE Smoke Alarm
This describes the Z-Wave device *ZSMOKE*, manufactured by *BRK Brands, Inc.* with the thing type UID of ```brk_zsmoke_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Smoke Detector*, defining Smoke detectors.

The ZSMOKE supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZSMOKE does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

### Wakeup Information

The ZSMOKE does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.
## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZSMOKE -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Alarm | alarm_general | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | Battery | Number |

### Alarm

Indicates if an alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_general``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | Ok |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level

Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```battery-level``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 1 configuration parameters available in the ZSMOKE.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Single Alarm).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSMOKE supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.
