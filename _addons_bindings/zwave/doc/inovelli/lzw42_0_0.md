The LZW42 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Let’s get to know your sweet new smart bulb! Good news is, it’s literally a normal bulb, but with tons of colored LED’s and powered by Z-Wave. I’m not really sure what else to write here other than maybe the silver part goes into the lamp and the white part shines the light. Also, remember to always keep power to your light bulb as the Z-Wave module needs power to send/receive commands

### Inclusion Information

  * Start the inclusion process on your HUB/Gateway.
  * Once the inclusion process has started, turn on and off power to the bulb 3x (ie: Turn On, Turn Off, Turn On, Turn Off, Turn On) and the bulb should flash 3x indicating it’s in inclusion mode. 
  * If the bulb was included successfully, it will blink one more time. If it was not included successfully, you may have to run an exclusion as mentioned above. If there’s still issues, please ensure your bulb is within range (Pages 2 & 3)

### Exclusion Information

Put your HUB in Exclusion mode and turn the power on/off/on/off/on/off/on (3x on and 2x off) until your bulb blinks three (3x) and then blinks 1x to confirm. Your HUB should say that the device is excluded.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the LZW42 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |

| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 
| Color Control | color_color | color_color | ColorLight | Color | 
| Color Temperature | color_temperature | color_temperature | ColorLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer
The brightness channel allows to control the brightness of a light.
            It is also possible to switch the light on and off.

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.

### Color Temperature
The color temperature channel allows to set the color
            temperature of a light from 0 (cold) to 100 (warm).

The ```color_temperature``` channel is of type ```color_temperature``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```ColorLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the LZW42.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 2 | Memory Function | 0 returns to last ON state, 1 = Returns to last state (ON or OFF) |
| 81 | Warm White Adjustment | Adjusts the warm white color component 2700 = 2700 Kelvin, 4999 = 4999 Kelvin |
| 82 | Cold White Adjustment | Adjusts the cold white color compontne. 5000 = 5000 Kelvin, 6500 = 6500 Kelvin |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 2: Memory Function

0 returns to last ON state, 1 = Returns to last state (ON or OFF)
When power is restored, the bulb reverts to its last ON state, or last state (ON or OFF). 0 returns to last ON state, 1 = Returns to last state (ON or OFF)
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 81: Warm White Adjustment

Adjusts the warm white color component 2700 = 2700 Kelvin, 4999 = 4999 Kelvin

Values in the range 2700 to 4999 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2700```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_81_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 82: Cold White Adjustment

Adjusts the cold white color compontne. 5000 = 5000 Kelvin, 6500 = 6500 Kelvin

Values in the range 5000 to 6500 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```6500```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_82_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW42 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
