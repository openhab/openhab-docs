The LZW60 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The LZW60 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

  * Light: Save energy by making sure lights don’t turn on if it’s bright enough.
  * Motion: Be notified when you’re away and automate your lighting.
  * Humidity: To avoid excess moisture, trigger fans and dehumidifiers.
  * Temperature: Smarter climate control by monitoring every room in your home.

### Inclusion Information

Put your hub into inclusion mode and press the button on the back of the 4-in-1 sensor one time.

### Exclusion Information

Put your hub into exclusion mode and press the button on the back of the 4-in-1 sensor one time.

### Wakeup Information

The LZW60 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To wake up the sensor so that your hub can send it configuration parameters quickly press on the button on the back 3 times.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the LZW60 -:

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The LZW60 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Group 1

Sensor will send updates
  1. Notification Report  
    Sensor will send notification report when motion detection unknown location and (event inactive)
  2. Multilevel Sensor Report  
    Sensor will send multilevel sensor report (temperature, humidity, luminance) interval of 2 hours
  3. Battery Report  
    Sensor will send battery report when the battery level is low and the battery report's value is 0xFF
  4. Device Reset Locally

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Send Basic Set when PIR is triggered

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
