The HE-HLS01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The HE-HLS01 High Load Switch with Thermostat Functions fits easily behind outlets making them ‘Impossibly Smart’ with over-the-Internet control and advanced programmability. In addition, built-in Power Consumption System helps to monitor how much energy was used. With included NTC temperature sensor it provides thermostat functions where a local display and controls are not needed. The High Load Switch also adds safety to your home by protecting against overloads, overheat, overvoltage, spark and surge conditions.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HE-HLS01 supports 4 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Used to connect Z-Wave gateway


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Relay Basic Set

Sends relay state (On/Off)
Group 2 –“Relay Basic Set”:is assigned to the HE-HLS01 relay state. It sends a Basic Set command with value 255 (On) when relay goes to On state and sends 0 (Off) when relay goes to Off state. The group supports five Nodes.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: S1 Basic Set

Sends external input state (On/Off)
Group 3 –“S1 Basic Set”:is assigned to the HE-HLS01 external input state. It sends a Basic Set command with value 255 (On) when external input is shorted and sends 0 (Off) when input is open. The group supports five Nodes.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Temperature Sensor

Sends external temperature values
Group 4 –“Temperature Sensor”:is assigned to the HE-HLS01 external temperature sensor and sends the sensor value when it changes. The group supports five nodes.

Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.
