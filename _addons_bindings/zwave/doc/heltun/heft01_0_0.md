The he-ft01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

## **Perfectly controls air conditioning systems**

The HE-FT01 is designed to maintain constant room temperatures by using internal air temperature sensor. It controls 2-pipe or 4-pipe air conditioning/heating systems such as: split/multi-split systems, chillers and fan coil unit systems, central air conditioning systems, multi-zone VRF/VRV air conditioning systems, etc. The fan speed is controlled by three relay outputs. Two more relay outputs control cooling and heating valves. The HE-FT01 has two independent inputs for relay channels which allow it to control fans and valves with different power sources or to use relay outputs as dry contacts. Each relay can carry a load of up to 5 Amps.

**Multiple built-in sensors**

The HE-FT01 has an LCD screen, six high sensitivity capacitive touch buttons, and internal temperature sensor with compensating software for precise temperature monitoring and control. It also has built-in humidity and illumination sensors. You can instantly access information from all sensors on the user-friendly display.

Monitor all important information without even a touch

The at-a-glance display shows: ambient air temperature, user set point, humidity level, current operating mode, climate mode, fan speed, time, day of the week, and status of the Z-Wave™ network. Display brightness adjusts to ambient light conditions automatically making it easy to read.

**Highly configurable**

You can select one of four operation modes (COM, TIME, ECO, OFF) with individual set points either manually or by using a Z-Wave controller/gateway. The HE-FT01 operates in four Climate Modes: Heating & Cooling, Heating only, Cooling only, and Ventilation and has six fan speed control modes: Low, Medium, High, Auto Medium, Auto High, & Off.

**Know how much energy you use**

The HE-FT01 built-in Power Consumption System monitors how much energy you used during any particular day, week, or month. Just specify the consumption of the load in watts for each relay channel and the thermostat logic will calculate total consumption relative to the time since the output was in the „ON‟ state.

**Based on the latest Z-Wave platform**

The HE-FT01 integrates a Z-Wave Plus™ v2 700 platform module allowing it to be used with Z-Wave home automation systems. The HE-FT01 supports Z-Wave „S0‟ and „S2‟ security protocols, SmartStart technology, and can be connected (“associated”) to other Z-Wave devices, such as relays, switchers, etc.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The he-ft01 supports 6 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reports full state of the device and used to communicate with the Z-Wave gateway.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set On/Off: Fan Low Speed (OUT-1)

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting OUT-1 operation. Max supported nodes: 1. The HE-FT01 sends Basic Set command with value 0 (Off) when the relay goes to OFF state and sends 255 (On) when the relay goes to ON state.

Association group 2 supports 1 node.

### Group 3: Basic Set On/Off: Fan Low Speed (OUT-2)

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting OUT-2 operation. Max supported nodes: 1. The HE-FT01 sends Basic Set command with value 0 (Off) when the relay goes to OFF state and sends 255 (On) when the relay goes to ON state.

Association group 3 supports 1 node.

### Group 4: Basic Set On/Off: Fan Low Speed (OUT-3)

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting OUT-3 operation. Max supported nodes: 1. The HE-FT01 sends Basic Set command with value 0 (Off) when the relay goes to OFF state and sends 255 (On) when the relay goes to ON state.

Association group 4 supports 1 node.

### Group 5: Basic Set On/Off: Heater OUT-4

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting OUT-4 operation. Max supported nodes: 1. The HE-FT01 sends Basic Set command with value 0 (Off) when the relay goes to OFF state and sends 255 (On) when the relay goes to ON state.

Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 6: Basic Set On/Off: Cooler OUT-5

is used to turn the associated devices on/off reflecting OUT-5 operation. Max supported nodes: 1. The HE-FT01 sends Basic Set command with value 0 (Off) when the relay goes to OFF state and sends 255 (On) when the relay goes to ON state.

Association group 6 supports 1 node.
