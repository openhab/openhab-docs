The HE-HT01 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The Heltun Heating Thermostat is built control the heating and mesures not only the room temperature with the build in sensor, but also humidity, lighting and the floor temperature if a sensor is attached.

### Inclusion Information

**To include the thermostat in the Z-Wave network**

  1. Enter “SETTINGS“ Mode by pressing and holding the Gear button for three seconds.
  2. If you need to change the device factory default Z-Wave frequency, see the Parameter description and steps to change the value on page 12 of documentation
  3. Scroll menu to “Parameter 2 – nEt“. The current state of the network will be displayed in the Parameter Value position (upper right). It should display “ECL“. Note: If “InC“ is displayed, the HE-HT01 must first be Excluded from an existing Z-Wave network (see “Removing from Z-Wave network“ below).
  4. Start the Inclusion Mode from openhab.
  5. On the HE-HT01 in the Parameter 2 press the Plus “+“ button to start the Inclusion process.
  6. Note that lines will be moving in the Parameter value position (upper right).
  7. “InC“ should appear at the Parameter Value position (and the icon on the main display bottom right corner) if Inclusion was successful.
  8. If “EСL“ or “Err“ is on Value position (or icon on the main display bottom right corner), the HE-HT01 Inclusion was not successful (try repeating steps 4-7).

### Exclusion Information

**To remove the thermostat in the Z-Wave network**

  1. Enter “SETTINGS“ Mode by pressing and holding the Gear button for three seconds.
  2. Scroll menu to “Parameter 2 – nEt“ using the Heating Element button to scroll up, and the “MODE“ button to scroll down.

  3. The current state of the network will display in the Parameter Value position (upper right). It should display “InC“. Note: If “EСL“ is displayed, the HE-HT01 is already Excluded.

  4. Start the Exclusion Mode from the openhab.

  5. Press the Minus “–“ button in the HE-HT01 Parameter 2 to start the Exclusion process

  6. Note that lines will be moving in the Parameter value position (upper right).

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HE-HT01 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Reports full state of the device and used to communicate with the Z-Wave gateway.


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set On/Off: Relay

is assigned to the HE-HT01 operating state. It sends a Basic Set command with value 0 (Off) when it goes to IDLE state and sends 255 (ON) when it goes into HEATING state


Association group 2 supports 1 node.
