# HM-DW001 Door/Window Contact
This describes the Z-Wave device *HM-DW001*, manufactured by *Erone* with the thing type UID of ```erone_hmdw001_00_000```.

The device is in the category of *Door*, defining Door sensors.

The HM-DW001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The HM-DW001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Door/Window Sensor is a Z-Wave® enabled device (interoperable, two-way RF mesh networking technology) and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network. Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer’s Z-Wave enabled networks. Each mains powered module in a Network is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will retransmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. 

### Inclusion Information

In the rear casing, there is a tamper switch which is used to carry out inclusion, exclusion or association.

  * Put a Z-WAVETM Wireless Controller into inclusion/exclusion mode,
  * Press the tamper switch on the detector to complete the inclusion/exclusion process.

The Door/Window Detector will stay “awake” for ten minutes when changing the status of tamper switch from being pressed to be released or from being released to be pressed to allow time for configuration. 

### Exclusion Information

In the rear casing, there is a tamper switch which is used to carry out inclusion, exclusion or association.

  * Put a Z-WAVETM Wireless Controller into inclusion/exclusion mode,
  * Press the tamper switch on the detector to complete the inclusion/exclusion process.

The Door/Window Detector will stay “awake” for ten minutes when changing the status of tamper switch from being pressed to be released or from being released to be pressed to allow time for configuration. 

### Wakeup Information

The HM-DW001 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To wake up the device manually, triple-click the tamper button on the back of the device.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the HM-DW001 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Binary Sensor | sensor_binary | sensor_binary |  | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Binary Sensor
Indicates if a sensor has triggered.

The ```sensor_binary``` channel is of type ```sensor_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Triggered |
| OFF | Untriggered |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the HM-DW001.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Basic Set Level | Value to be sent with a BASIC SET command |
| 2 | Configuring the OFF Delay | OFF Delay in seconds |
|  | Wakeup Interval | Sets the interval at which the device will accept commands from the controller |
|  | Wakeup Node | Sets the node ID of the device to receive the wakeup notifications |

### Parameter 1: Basic Set Level

Value to be sent with a BASIC SET command

Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Configuring the OFF Delay

OFF Delay in seconds

Values in the range 0 to 127 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Interval

The wakeup interval sets the period at which the device will listen for messages from the controller. This is required for battery devices that sleep most of the time in order to conserve battery life. The device will wake up at this interval and send a message to the controller to tell it that it can accept messages - after a few seconds, it will go back to sleep if there is no further communications. 

This setting is defined in *seconds*. It is advisable not to set this interval too short or it could impact battery life. A period of 1 hour (3600 seconds) is suitable in most instances.

Note that this setting does not affect the devices ability to send sensor data, or notification events.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_interval``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Wakeup Node

When sleeping devices wake up, they send a notification to a listening device. Normally, this device is the network controller, and normally the controller will set this automatically to its own address.
In the event that the network contains multiple controllers, it may be necessary to configure this to a node that is not the main controller. This is an advanced setting and should not be changed without a full understanding of the impact.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```wakeup_node``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The HM-DW001 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Tamper Event Report (Alarm Report)


Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Control other Z-Wave Devices


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
