## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the BTZEUMV1 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Door Lock | lock_door | lock_door | Door | Switch | 
| Alarm (access) | alarm_access | alarm_access | Door | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | time_offset | Temperature | Number | 

### Door Lock
Lock and unlock the door.

The ```lock_door``` channel is of type ```lock_door``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category.
The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| ON | Locked |
| OFF | Unlocked |

### Alarm (access)
Indicates if the access control alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_access``` channel is of type ```alarm_access``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.
### Clock Time Offset
Provides the current time difference for the devices time.

The ```time_offset``` channel is of type ```time_offset``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.



## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The BTZEUMV1 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline

Association group 1 supports 1 node.
