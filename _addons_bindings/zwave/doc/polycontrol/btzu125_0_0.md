## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/407) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the BTZW125 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
