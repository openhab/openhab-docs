## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN76 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.


Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: BASIC SET

BINARY SWITCH REPORT
This on/off switch supports Group 1 with up to 1 devices for lifeline communication and Group 2 with up to 5 devices.  
This device will send BINARY SWITCH REPORT to Group 1 and 2 when operated manually.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
