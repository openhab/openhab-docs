The ZEN15 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

No device information is provided in the database. Consider [updating the database](http://www.cd-jackson.com/index.php/zwave/zwave-device-database/zwave-device-list/devicesummary/758) to improve the documentation.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZEN15 -:

| Channel | Channel Id | Category | Item Type |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Switch | switch_binary | Switch | Switch | 
| Scene Number | scene_number |  | Number | 
| Electric meter (volts) | meter_voltage | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (amps) | meter_current | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (kWh) | meter_kwh | Energy | Number | 
| Electric meter (watts) | meter_watts | Energy | Number | 

### Switch

Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Scene Number

Triggers when a scene button is pressed.

The ```scene_number``` channel supports the ```Number``` item.

The ```meter_kwh``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Electric meter (watts)

Indicates the instantaneous power consumption.

The ```meter_watts``` channel supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZEN15.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 20 | Overload Protection | Overload protection. |
| 21 | On/Off Status Recovery After Power Failure | Choose the recovery state for your Power Switch if power outage occurs. |
| 24 | On/Off Status Change Notifications | Send On/Off Status Change Notifications |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 20: Overload Protection

Overload protection.
Overload protection will turn the Power Switch relay off once power exceeds 16.5A for over 5 seconds when this setting is enabled.

We DO NOT recommend changing this parameterâ€™s value as it may result in device damage and malfunction.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_20_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 21: On/Off Status Recovery After Power Failure

Choose the recovery state for your Power Switch if power outage occurs.

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Previous state |
| 1 | ON |
| 2 | OFF |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Previous state).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_21_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 24: On/Off Status Change Notifications

Send On/Off Status Change Notifications
Your Power Switch will automatically send a notification to the controller and other associated devices if its status changes from on to off or the other way round. Choose when you want it to send the report.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Sends notification if status is changed manually or remotely |
| 2 | Sends notification ONLY if status is changed manually |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Sends notification if status is changed manually or remotely).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_24_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN15 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Group 1


This group supports 5 nodes.
