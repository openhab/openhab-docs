### Parameter 1: LED Indicator

LED Indicator options
Choose if you want the LED to indicate the on/off status of the load or if you want it to remain on or off at all times.

Values: 0 – LED always off; 1 – LED on when load on, LED off when load off. Default: 1
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 1 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED always off |
| 1 | LED on when load on, LED off when load off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (LED on when load on, LED off when load off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: On/Off Status After Power Failure

Controls for status after power failure
Set the on off status for the relay after power failure.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 2 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | always off once restored |
| 1 | always on once restored |
| 2 | remembers and restores status |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2``` (remembers and restores status).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Status Report Type

Status Report Type
Choose physical (wall switch) and Z-Wave triggers for the relay to send a status change report to the hub.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Scene Control

Scene Control
Enable or disable scene control functionality for quick double tap triggers.
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Input Type

Input Type (input to the relay, not load)
Choose the wall switch or input type you want to connect to the relay. *Not all values are supported on all hubs. Please check the How to Access the Advanced Settings for My ZEN58 article for your hub for more information.

IMPORTANT: If you set this parameter to value 4-12, you’ll need to exclude and re-include the device (without changing any settings) so that a child device is created for the input of your choice!

NOTE: When the relay is first powered, the default settings should auto-detect the external switch type after it has been toggled once. If auto-detect fails to detect the proper input type and you are using a hub that does not provide access to the advanced settings, you can also manually configure the external switch type: Quickly press the Z-Wave Button 5 times within 2 seconds. The relay will enter into a switch type selecting mode. The LED will flash in green to indicate the switch type it should connect: Flash once every 2 seconds – Toggle Switch; Flash twice every 2 seconds – Momentary Switch; Flash 3 times every 2 seconds – Toggle switch with fixed actions (NO/NC Switch); Flash 4 times every 2 seconds – 3-way impulse control.

When in the switch type selecting mode, press the Z-Wave Button ONCE in sequence to shift the switch types.

After the switch type matches the external switch you have connected, press and hold the Z-Wave Button for more than 1 second to confirm the selection. If the selection is not confirmed in 30 seconds, the Relay will exit the switch type selecting mode.

Once this functionality is disabled, double taps, held, released, 3-tap, 4-tap, and 5-tap events will be ignored and won't be reported to the hub. The inclusion and exclusion 3-toggle functionality from the external switch will also be disabled.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 1 -:

NOTE: This will not affect the relay behavior if you leave the input linked to the output (parameter 11). It will still trigger the relay to turn on when the circuit is closed, regardless of the reported value. This setting only affects the reports displayed in the hub for the input and does not affect the relay (output) behavior.
The following option values may be configured, in addition to values in the range 0 to 1 -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | values reported as normally open, not reversed |
| 1 | input values reversed |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (values reported as normally open, not reversed).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_13_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN58 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline Group

Lifeline Group communication with up to 5 devices. This device will send BASIC REPORT and SWITCH BINARY REPORT to Group 1

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off Control

On/Off Control: This device will send BASIC SET command to Group 2 with up to 5 devices for On/Off control when the status changes. Supported when Parameter 5 is set to a values 0-9.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: EP2 On/Off Control

EP2 On/Off Control: This device will send BASIC SET command to Group 3 (for EP2) with up to 5 devices for On/Off control when the status changes. Supported when Parameter 5 is set to a value of 10.

You can set direct association to have the relay control another Z-Wave device independently of the hub by using Group 2 or Group 3. Not every hub exposes direct association settings in the interface so please check with your system provider for details.

Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.
