**2. Finalize inclusion at the actuator.****  
** 

  * **Tap THE Z-WAVE BUTTON 3 TIMES** if using traditional Z-Wave inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring your Titan Valve Actuator close to the Z-Wave gateway (hub), if possible.
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into **exclusion mode**.
  3. Tap the Z-Wave button **3 times quickly** (it will flash and beep once each time you tap to confirm communication).
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion, the LED indicator on the actuator will turn green for 3 seconds, and the device will sound 2 short beeps for a successful exclusion. The actuator will disappear from your controller’s device list. The LED indicator on the Titan will go back to the yellow blinking mode.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZAC36 supports 5 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Basic Set for Open / Close


Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 3: Basic Set for Leak Alarm


Association group 3 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 4: Basic Set for Overheat Alarm


Association group 4 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 5: Basic Set for Freeze Alarm


Association group 5 supports 5 nodes.
