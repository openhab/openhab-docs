| Alarm (power) | alarm_power | alarm_power | Energy | Switch | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |

### Switch
Switch the power on and off.

The ```switch_binary``` channel is of type ```switch_binary``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Switch``` category.

### Sensor (temperature)
Indicates the current temperature.

The ```sensor_temperature``` channel is of type ```sensor_temperature``` and supports the ```Number:Temperature``` item and is in the ```Temperature``` category.

### Sensor (relative humidity)
Indicates the current relative humidity.

The ```sensor_relhumidity``` channel is of type ```sensor_relhumidity``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Humidity``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

### Custom sound selection for audio speaker
0=pause (no sound, default)

1-99=sound (file) number in the library to be triggered

Generic class for configuration parameter.

The ```config_decimal``` channel is of type ```config_decimal``` and supports the ```Number``` item.

### Alarm (burglar)
Indicates if the burglar alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_burglar``` channel is of type ```alarm_burglar``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Door``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Alarm (power)
Indicates if a power alarm is triggered.

The ```alarm_power``` channel is of type ```alarm_power``` and supports the ```Switch``` item and is in the ```Energy``` category. This is a read only channel so will only be updated following state changes from the device.

The following state translation is provided for this channel to the ```Switch``` item type -:

| Value | Label     |
|-------|-----------|
| OFF | OK |
| ON | Alarm |

### Battery Level
Represents the battery level as a percentage (0-100%). Bindings for things supporting battery level in a different format (e.g. 4 levels) should convert to a percentage to provide a consistent battery level reading.

The ```system.battery-level``` channel is of type ```system.battery-level``` and supports the ```Number``` item and is in the ```Battery``` category.
This channel provides the battery level as a percentage and also reflects the low battery warning state. If the battery state is in low battery warning state, this will read 0%.


## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 3 configuration parameters available in the ZSE19 .
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Siren alarm duration | Siren alarm duration |
| 2 | Temperature and humidity reporting interval | Temperature and humidity reporting interval |
| 3 | Custom sound selection for audio speaker | Custom sound selection for audio speaker |

### Parameter 1: Siren alarm duration

Siren alarm duration
Choose how long you want the siren alarm to last for once it's triggered. The number entered as value corresponds to the number of seconds.
Values in the range 10 to 600 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```180```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Temperature and humidity reporting interval

Temperature and humidity reporting interval
Choose how often you want the Multisiren to report temperature and humidity readings. The number entered as value corresponds to the number of minutes. Frequent reports will decrease battery life.
Values in the range 1 to 1440 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```30```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_2``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Custom sound selection for audio speaker

Custom sound selection for audio speaker
Enable one of the custom sounds in the audio file library. The number entered as value corresponds to the file number in the library. Audio Speaker is an optional feature enabled by the brand new Sound Switch command class. This feature is **separate from the siren alarm** (the sound or volume of the siren can’t be adjusted) and once fully enabled, it allows you to play different sounds from the library based on different Z-Wave triggers and events. The default value (0) disables the custom sound. The file in position 2 is reserved for the tamper switch notification.

**How to manage the audio file library (for Audio Speaker only)**

  1. Plug the Multisiren to your computer/laptop using the mini USB port.
  2. Follow the prompts on the screen to run the manager.
  3. Use the file navigation menu on the le to locate your file source.
  4. Select the files you want to upload to the Multisiren. Accepted formats: 
      * **.wav files in Mono only** (you need to convert any Mp3’s)
      * Sample rate: 8KHz – 32KHz
      * Max length per file: 30 seconds (total max length of all files: 85 sec.)
  5. Click on the upload icon in the bottom left corner on the window.
  6. Your library is now updated. You can use the up/down arrow icons to change the file order in the library. Note that the no. 2 file in the library is reserved for tamper switch notification playback.
  7. Close the Library Manager soware, remove the USB cable, and power cycle your Multisiren by taking one of the batteries out and reinserting it.
Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZSE19  supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Z-Wave Plus Lifeline
This Multisiren supports Group 1 with up to 5 devices for lifeline communication. This device will send the following information to Group 1:

  * Notification Report when it’s powered or when the tamper is triggered
  * Battery Report when battery drops or is getting low
  * Device Reset Locally Notification aer factory reset
  * Switch Binary Report when siren is triggered or when it stops
  * Multilevel Sensor Report for temperature and humidity data

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
