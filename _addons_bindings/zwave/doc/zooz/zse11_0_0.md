The ZSE11 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  * Quick and reliable motion alerts to Z-Wave hub
  * Accurate temperature and humidity monitoring
  * Lux sensor for smart light automation
  * Battery or Micro USB power
  * The latest S2 security and Z-Wave Plus chip
  * Supports OTA fiormware updates
  * Built-in tamper switch for extra security

### Inclusion Information

  1. Put your Z-Wave hub into inclusion mode.
  2. Click the Z-Wave button 3 times as quickly as possible. The LED indicator will start blinking to confirm inclusion mode and turn off once inclusion is completed. The sensor will automatically pair as a repeater if connected to USB power, so special button sequence required.

NEVER include the sensor powered with USB and then switch over to batteries. Your hub will recognize the sensor as a Z-Wave repeater and the batteries will drain quickly. Always include the sensor powered by batteries only if you're planning to use it as a battery device.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring the sensor within direct range of your Z-Wave gateway (hub).
  2. Put the Z-Wave binding into exclusion mode.
  3. Press and release the Z-Wave button 3 times quickly.
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and the sensor will disappear from your controller's device list.

### General Usage Information

  * This product should be installed indoors or outdoors in a sheltered area upon completion of any building renovations.
  * Prior to installation, the device should be stored in a dry, dust-and-mold-proof place.
  * Do not install the device in a place with direct sun exposure, high temperature, or humidity.
  * Keep away from chemicals, water, and dust.
  * Ensure the device is never close to any heat source or open flame to prevent fire.
  * No part of the device may be replaced or repaired by the user except for the batteries.
