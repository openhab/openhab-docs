The ZEN22 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  * Manual or remote on/off and dimming control from your mobile device or computer (when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller)
  * Universal 3-way capability – works with existing 3-way switches as long as neutral is present
  * Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication
  * Works with LED, CFL, and incandescent bulbs
  * Remembers and restores on/off / brightness status after power failure
  * Based on universal multilevel switch command class - supported by most Z-Wave controllers
  * May be associated and grouped with other Z-Wave devices for advanced home automation
  * Customizeable LED indicator
  * Air-gap switch for added safety
  * Modern paddle design
  * Built-in Z-Wave signal repeater for a stronger, more reliable network

| 2 | LED Indicator Control | Choose LED Functionality |
| 3 | Enable / Disable LED Indicator  | Enable or disable the LED indicator |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Paddle Control

Choose Paddle Functionality

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Upper paddle turns on, lower paddle turns off |
| 1 | Upper paddle turns off, lower paddle turns on |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Upper paddle turns off, lower paddle turns on).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: LED Indicator Control

Choose LED Functionality

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | LED on when switch off, LED off when switch off |
| 1 | LED on when switch on, LED off when switch off |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (LED on when switch off, LED off when switch off).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Enable / Disable LED Indicator 

Enable or disable the LED indicator

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN22 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
