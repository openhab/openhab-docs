The ZEN27 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  * Manual or Z-Wave on/off and brightness control
  * Simple Direct 3-Way: connect with existing on/off switches in 3-way,4-way, and 5-way set-ups, no add-on needed (neutral wire required)
  * Fully adjustable ramp rate for just the right on/off speed
  * Double tap to full brightness feature
  * Remembers and restores on/off status a?er power failure
  * Built-in Z-Wave Plus signal repeater to extend network range
  * Extended compatibility with LED bulbs, no more flickering!
  * S2 security protocol and the latest 500 Z-Wave chip
  * Customizable LED indicator and air-gap switch for added safety

### Inclusion Information

  1. Initiate inclusion (pairing) in the app (or web interface).
  2. Finalize inclusion at the switch. TAP 3 TIMES QUICKLY. The LED indicator will blink to signal communication and remain on for 2 seconds to confirm inclusion.

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway (hub) close to the switch if possible
  2. Put the Z-Wave hub into exclusion mode
  3. Tap the lower paddle on the switch 3 times quickly
  4. Your hub will confirm exclusion and the device will disappear from your controller's device list

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN27 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
This dimmer switch supports Group 1 with up to 1 devices for lifeline communication

and Group 2 with up to 5 devices. This device will send

MULTILEVEL REPORT to Group 1 and 2 when operated manually.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

### Group 2: Status

This dimmer switch supports Group 1 with up to 1 devices for lifeline communication and Group 2 with up to 5 devices. This device will send MULTILEVEL REPORT to Group 1 and 2 when operated manually.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.
