The ZEN24 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

  * Manual or remote on/off and dimming control from your mobile device or computer (when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller)
  * Universal 3-way capability – works with existing 3-way switches as long as neutral is present
  * Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication
  * Works with LED, CFL, and incandescent bulbs
  * Remembers and restores on/off / brightness status after power failure
  * Based on universal multilevel switch command class - supported by most Z-Wave controllers
  * May be associated and grouped with other Z-Wave devices for advanced home automation
  * Air-gap switch for added safety
  * Classic toggle design
  * Built-in Z-Wave signal repeater for a stronger, more reliable network
  * Configurable Ramp-Rate (Two options)

### Inclusion Information

  1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller into inclusion mode
  3. Toggle the switch UP 3 times very quickly to finalize the inclusion process
  4. A new dimming device will appear on your controller's device list

**TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:** 

If you are unable to include the Z-Wave switch to your controller, please try one of the following:

  * Bring the controller closer to your ZWave switch or use a hand-held secondary controller for inclusion
  * Toggle your Z-Wave switch UP even quicker at least 5 or 7 times once you put the controller into inclusion mode to ensure the command has gone through
  * Put your controller into EXCLUSION mode and toggle the switch DOWN 3 times quickly, then try adding it to your network again

### Exclusion Information

  1. Bring your Z-Wave gateway hub or controller as close to the switch as possible
  2. Put your Z-Wave controller into exclusion mode 3. Toggle the switch DOWN
  3. times very quickly to complete the exclusion process
  4. The device will disappear from your controller's device list

Please repeat the process following all steps carefully if the first attempt is unsuccessful.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the ZEN24 -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Dimmer | switch_dimmer | switch_dimmer | DimmableLight | Dimmer | 

### Dimmer

The ```switch_dimmer``` channel is of type ```switch_dimmer``` and supports the ```Dimmer``` item and is in the ```DimmableLight``` category.



## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the ZEN24.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Toggle Control | Controls behavior of the toggle switch |
| 4 | Ramp Rate Control | Choose from 2 ramp rate options (fade-in / fade-out effect) |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Toggle Control

Controls behavior of the toggle switch
Choose if you want the to turn the light on by clicking the toggle up or down Values:

0 – Toggle up turns the light on, toggle down turns the light off (default);

1 – Toggle up turns the light off, toggle down turns the light on
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Ramp Rate Control

Choose from 2 ramp rate options (fade-in / fade-out effect)
Choose from 2 ramp rate options (fade-in / fade-out effect for on / off operation)
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Slow Ramp Rate |
| 1 | Fast Ramp Rate |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0``` (Slow Ramp Rate).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN24 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Once the Z-Wave switch is added to your network, you are able to turn the device on or off and adjust brightness remotely from your mobile device, computer, or Z-Wave remote control. Depending on your Z-Wave gateway's home automation software capabilities, you may be able to associate your ZWave switch in groups with other ZWave devices to schedule scenes and create events. This toggle dimmer switch supports Group 1 with up to 5 devices for lifeline communication. This device will send MULTILEVEL REPORT to Group 1 when operated manually. Please refer to your controller's user guide for advanced programming instructions as they are a little different for each software.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
