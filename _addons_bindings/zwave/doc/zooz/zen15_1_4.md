### General Usage Information

## How to test Z-Wave network range for my Power Switch?

You can easily check if the Power Switch is within your Z-Wave controller’s range:  
Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 6 to 9 seconds until the LED indicator turns violet.

The LED indicator will then report signal strength.

  * Flashing green = direct communication with the primary controller is established and still being diagnosed 
  * Solid green for 2 seconds = direct communication with the primary controller is stable 
  * Flashing orange = direct communication with the primary controller is intermittent and being diagnosed 
  * Solid orange = communication quality is fair 
  * Solid red = communication with the primary controller has failed

Press and release the Z-Wave button to exit testing mode.

## The LED indicator on your Power Switch will visually report power consumption and network range.

How to read LED indicator colors?

  * Pink = Power Switch is off
  * Blue = 0 – 300 W
  * Cyan = 300 – 600 W
  * Green = 600 – 900 W
  * Yellow = 900 – 1200 W
  * Red = 1200 – 1500 W
  * Purple = 1500 – 1800 W
  * Purple blink = over 1800 W

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN15 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
