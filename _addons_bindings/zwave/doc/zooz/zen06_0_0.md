The ZEN06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

## Product features: 

  * Manual and remote on / off control 
  * Energy monitoring 
  * Scene inclusion for custom automation scenarios when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller 
  * LED indicator displaying Z-Wave signal strength and power usage 
  * Security enabled Z-Wave device with AES signal encryption (requires a security enabled gateway controller for full functionality) 
  * Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication 
  * Built-in range extender for a stronger, more reliable network 
  * 2 USB charging ports for your smart phone or tablet (no Z-Wave functionality) 
  * Built-in overload protection in Z-Wave outlet and USB ports 

## How to read LED indicator colors?

  * Burgundy = Smart Plug is off
  * Blue = 0 – 300 W
  * Cyan = 300 – 600 W
  * Green = 600 – 900 W
  * Yellow = 900 – 1200 W
  * Red = 1200 – 1500 W
  * Purple = 1500 – 1800 W
  * Purple blink = over 1800 W

## How to test Z-Wave network range for my Smart Plug?

You can easily check if the Smart Plug is within your Z-Wave controller’s range.

### Here is how:

Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 6 to 9 seconds until the LED indicator turns violet.

The LED indicator will then report signal strength.

  * Flashing green = direct communication with the primary controller is established and still being diagnosed
  * Solid green for 2 seconds = direct communication with the primary controller is stable
  * Flashing orange = direct communication with the primary controller is intermittent and being diagnosed
  * Solid orange = communication quality is fair
  * Solid red = communication with the primary controller has failed
  * Press and release the Z-Wave button to exit testing mode.

NOTE: This function may only be activated once the Smart Plug has been included to a ZWave network.

### Inclusion Information

Press and release the Z-Wave button 3 TIMES QUICKLY

### Exclusion Information

Press and release the Z-Wave button 3 TIMES QUICKLY

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The ZEN06 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
