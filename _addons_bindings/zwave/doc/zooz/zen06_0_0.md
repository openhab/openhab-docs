The ZEN06 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

Product features: 
------------------

- Manual and remote on / off control
- Energy monitoring
- Scene inclusion for custom automation scenarios when included to a Z-Wave gateway controller
- LED indicator displaying Z-Wave signal strength and power usage
- Security enabled Z-Wave device with AES signal encryption (requires a security enabled gateway controller for full functionality)
- Z-Wave Plus with improved 500 chip for faster and safer wireless communication
- Built-in range extender for a stronger, more reliable network
- 2 USB charging ports for your smart phone or tablet (no Z-Wave functionality)
- Built-in overload protection in Z-Wave outlet and USB ports

How to read LED indicator colors?
---------------------------------

- Burgundy = Smart Plug is off
- Blue = 0 – 300 W
- Cyan = 300 – 600 W
- Green = 600 – 900 W
- Yellow = 900 – 1200 W
- Red = 1200 – 1500 W
- Purple = 1500 – 1800 W
- Purple blink = over 1800 W

How to test Z-Wave network range for my Smart Plug?
---------------------------------------------------

You can easily check if the Smart Plug is within your Z-Wave controller’s range.

### Here is how:

Press and hold the Z-Wave button for 6 to 9 seconds until the LED indicator turns violet.

The LED indicator will then report signal strength.

- Flashing green = direct communication with the primary controller is established and still being diagnosed
- Solid green for 2 seconds = direct communication with the primary controller is stable
- Flashing orange = direct communication with the primary controller is intermittent and being diagnosed
- Solid orange = communication quality is fair
- Solid red = communication with the primary controller has failed
- Press and release the Z-Wave button to exit testing mode.

NOTE: This function may only be activated once the Smart Plug has been included to a ZWave network.
