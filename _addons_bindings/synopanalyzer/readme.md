# Synop Analyzer Binding

This binding integrates the possibility to download and interpret Synop messages.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options itself, all configuration is done at 'Things' level.

## Supported Things

There is exactly one supported thing, which represents a Synop message. It has the id `synopanalyzer`.

## Thing Configuration

Besides the Synop Station Number (as ```synopID``` as a [StationID](http://www.ogimet.com/gsynop_nav.phtml.en) string), the second configuration parameter is ```refreshInterval``` which defines the refresh interval in minutes.
Synop message are typically updated every hour.


## Channels

The weather information that is retrieved is available as these channels:

| Channel Type ID     | Item Type | Description                                |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| temperature         | Number    | The current temperature in degrees Celsius |
| pressure            | Number    | The current pressure in millibar (mb)      |
| wind-angle          | Number    | Wind angle in degrees                      |
| wind-direction      | String    | Wind direction                             |
| wind-speed-ms       | Number    | Wind speed in m/s                          |
| wind-speed-knots    | Number    | Wind speed in knots                        |
| wind-speed-beaufort | Number    | Wind speed according to Beaufort scale     |
| overcast            | String    | Appreciation of the cloud cover            |
| octa                | Number    | Part of the sky covered by clouds (in 8th) |
| attenuation-factor* | Number    | Cloud layer attenuation factor             |
| time-utc            | DateTime  | Observation time of the Synop message      |

*   ”cloud attenuation factor” (Kc) as defined by Kasten and Czeplak (1980)

## Example

### Things

Here is an example of thing definition :

```
synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:orly [ stationId="07149"]
```

### Items

```
Number Synop_Temperature "Temperature [%.1f °C]" <temperature> { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:temperature" }
Number Synop_Pressure "Pressure [%.1f mb]" <pressure> { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:pressure" }
Number Synop_Wind_Angle "Wind Angle [%d°]" <wind>     { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:wind-angle"}
String Synop_Wind_Direction "Direction [%s]" { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:wind-direction"}
Number Synop_Wind_Speed "Wind Speed [%.2f m/s]" <wind> { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:wind-speed-ms"}
Number Synop_Octa "Octa [%d]/8" { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:octa"}
DateTime Synop_time  "Observation Time [%1$ta %1$tR]"        <clock>   { channel = "synopanalyzer:synopanalyzer:trappes:time-utc"}
```
