# Oceanic Binding

This binding integrates the Oceanic water softener and management system (www.oceanic.be).
The binding supports the Limex IQ and Limex Pro water softeners.
The Oceanic systems are also distributed by Syr in Germany (www.syr.de).
In order to integrate the Limex into openHAB, the optional CAN-Serial gateway has to be installed.

## Supported Things

Softener

## Thing Configuration

The Thing configuration requires the name of the serial port that is used to connect the ESH host with the Oceanic unit, and the interval period in seconds to poll the Oceanic unit

## Channels

All devices support the following channels (non-exhaustive):

## Known issues

The Oceanic binding makes use of the nrjavaserial library.
There is a known issue (<https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/nrjavaserial/issues/96>) that requires a workaround on some types of systems.

On Ubuntu 17.10 nrjavaserial seems to return only HEX 00 characters through the InputStream of the SerialPort.
The solution is to implement a workaround with socat and pipe the data from the Serial Port to a pseudo tty, which has to be manipulated in a CommPortIdentifier.PORT_RAW manner.

```
             /usr/bin/socat -v /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0 pty,link=/dev/ttyS1,raw,echo=0
```         
The workaround can be implemented using a systemd system manager script, for example:

```
             [Install]
             WantedBy=multi-user.target   

             [Service]
             #Type=forking
             ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat -v /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0 pty,link=/dev/ttyS1,raw,echo=0
             #PIDFile=/var/run/socat.pid
             User=root
             Restart=always
             RestartSec=10             
```

However, in order to fix permissions at the OS level, one has to issue following commands

```
             sudo useradd  -G dialout openhab
             sudo chgrp dialout /dev/ttyS1
             sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyS1        
```

In order to make /dev/ttyS1 accessible by the 'openhab' system user (that is used to start up the openHAB runtime), and to make the tty both readable and writable.
Alternatively, these commands can be executed through a script that is attached to the systemd system manager script.
