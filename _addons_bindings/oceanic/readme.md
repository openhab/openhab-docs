# Oceanic Binding

This binding integrates the Oceanic water softener and management system (www.oceanic.be). The binding supports the Limex IQ and Limex Pro water softeners. The Oceanic systems are also distributed by Syr in Germany (www.syr.de). In order to integrate the Limex into openHAB, the optional CAN-Serial gateway has to be installed

## Supported Things

Softener

## Thing Configuration

The Thing configuration requires the name of the serial port that is used to connect the ESH host with the Oceanic unit, and the interval period in seconds to poll the Oceanic unit

## Channels

All devices support the following channels (non-exhaustive):

| Channel Type ID | Item Type    | Description  |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------- |------------- |
| alarm | String  | Current alarm description, if any|
| alert | String | Current alert description, if any, to notify a shortage of salt |
| totalflow | Number | Current flow in l/min |
| maxflow | Number | Maximum flow recorded, in l/min |
| reserve | Number | Water reserve in l before regeneration has to start |
| cycle | String | Indicates the stage of the regeneration cycle |
| endofcycle | String | Indicates the time to the end of the current cycle |
| endofgeneration | String | Indicates the time to the end of the current generation |
| inlethardness | Number | Water hardness at the inlet |
| outlethardness | Number | Water hardness at the outlet |
| salt | String | Volume of salt remaining, in kg |
| consumption(today)(currentweek)(...) | String | Water consumption, in l, for that period |
| regeneratenow | Switch | Start an immediate regeneration |
| regeneratelater | Switch | Start a delayed regeneration |
| lastgeneration | DateTime | Date and Time of the last regeneration cycle |
| pressure | Number | Water pressure, in bar |
| minpressure | Number | Minimum water pressure recorded, in bar |
| maxpressure | Number | Maximum water pressure recorded, in bar |
| normalregenerations | Number | Number of regenerations completed |
| serviceregenerations | Number | Number of service regenerations completed |
| incompleteregenerations | Number | Number of incomplete regenerations |
| allregenerations | Number | Number of all regenerations |
