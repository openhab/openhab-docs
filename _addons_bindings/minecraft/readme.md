# Minecraft Binding

This binding integrates Minecraft with openHAB through the [spigot plugin](https://github.com/ibaton/bukkit-openhab-plugin/releases/download/1.5/OHMinecraft.jar) ([sources](https://github.com/ibaton/bukkit-openhab-plugin/tree/master)).

The binding allows reading of server and player data.
It furthermore keeps track of redstone power going below signs and links them to Switch items.
