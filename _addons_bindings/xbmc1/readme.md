# XBMC binding (for KODI) (1.x)

This binding allows openHAB items to receive realtime updates about information like player state and running media from one or more instances of KODI (formerly known as XBMC).

[![openhab binding for xbmc](http://img.youtube.com/vi/N7_5phTVbo0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7_5phTVbo0)

There is also a binding specifically for openHAB 2 [here](http://docs.openhab.org/addons/bindings/kodi/readme.html).

## Prerequisites

This binding has been developed and tested from XBMC Frodo (v12) to Kodi Jarvis (v16.1).

The binding uses XBMCs JSON-RPC API v6, both the HTTP and the websocket transports. These therefore need to be enabled and need to be reachable from your openHAB host (think firewall, routing etc.)

## Binding Configuration

This binding can be configured in the file `services/xbmc.cfg`.

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| `<instance>`.host | |   Yes   | Hostname / IP address of your XBMC host |
| `<instance>`.rsPort | 8080 | No | Port number for the JSON RPC service |
| `<instance>`.wsPort | 9090 | No | Port number for the websocket service |
| `<instance>`.username | xbmc | No | Username to connect to XBMC |
| `<instance>`.password| xbmc | No | Password to connect to XBMC |
| refreshInterval  | 60000 | No | Refresh interval, in milliseconds (60000 is one minute) |

where `<instance>` is a name you choose for the instance of XBMC you want to control, `livingroom` for instance.  When defining your items, you can use the `<instance>` name to refer to your instances. In doing so, you can easily change the address by which you XBMC instance can be reached without having to reconfigure all of your items. 

### Configuration Example

```
livingRoom.host=192.168.1.6
livingRoom.rsPort=8080
livingRoom.wsPort=9090
livingRoom.username=xbmc
livingRoom.password=xbmc
refreshInterval=60000
```

Although you *can* configure one or more instances, it is not strictly necessary to do so. As long as you don't intend to use ports or login data different from the default, you could just as well use this by directly referring to hostnames or IP addresses in you item binding configuration.

## Item Configuration

Items can be bound to the XBMC binding using this format:

```
xbmc="<direction>[<host>|<property>]"
```

where:

* `<direction>` is `<` for incoming (player state, media title etc.), `>` for outgoing (Send "Play/Pause" or "Stop" etc.) or `=` for bi-directional (send/receive volume)
* `<host>` is a named `<instance>` prefixed with `#`, or without the `#` prefix it's interpreted as a hostname or IP address.
* `<property>` is the property to bind to (more on this below)

### Available properties

The list of properties you can use in your binding configuration is:

## Examples

### Basic Items

```
String XBMC_LR_PlayerState  "XBMC String" {xbmc="<[#livingRoom|Player.State]"}
String XBMC_LR_PlayerTitle  "XBMC String" {xbmc="<[#livingRoom|Player.Title]"}

String XBMC_BR_PlayerState  "XBMC String" {xbmc="<[#bedroom|Player.State]"}

String XBMC_IP_PlayerState  "XBMC String" {xbmc="<[192.168.1.6|Player.State]"}
String XBMC_DNS_PlayerState "XBMC String" {xbmc="<[xbmc.local|Player.Title]"}

Number XBMC_LR_Volume       "XBMC Number" {xbmc="=[#livingRoom|Application.Volume]"} 
```

### Rule Example

As can be seen in the introduction video, i have a dimmable lamp next to my tv. I use this to light up the room after sunset when i press pause and go back to the previous level on resume, unless the lamp state has been altered while on pause.

This is of course an example very specific to my preferences, but should give you an idea on what can be done.

```
import java.util.Date

var Number brightnessBeforePause

rule "Lights on when paused"
when
        Item LivingRoom_XBMC changed from Play to Pause
then
        var Date sunsetTime = (G_SUNSET_V.state as DateTimeType).calendar.time
        var Date sunriseTime = (G_SUNRISE_V.state as DateTimeType).calendar.time
        if( now.toDate().after(sunsetTime) || now.toDate().before(sunriseTime)){
                brightnessBeforePause = LivingRoom_Lamp.state as DecimalType
                if ( brightnessBeforePause < 50){
                        sendCommand( LivingRoom_Lamp, "50")     
                }
        }
end

rule "Lights off when pause end"
when
        Item LivingRoom_XBMC changed from Pause to Play
then
        if (LivingRoom_Lamp.state == 50){               
                sendCommand( LivingRoom_Lamp, brightnessBeforePause)
        }
end
```

### XBMC with Wake-On-LAN and Network Health Bindings

The following configuration can be used to power on your XBMC machine using the Wake-On-LAN Binding and power it off using the XBMC Binding. The Network Health binding updates the state after some time if XBMC was powered on or off without using openHAB. You have to insert your own IP and MAC address of course.

```
Switch XBMC_Power "XBMC Power" {xbmc=">[#openelec|System.Shutdown]", wol="192.168.1.0#xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", nh="openelec:80"}
```

### Using Player.Open

To use the Player.Open command, you would need to define a String item with this binding, then send an Update to this String item. This will cause Openhab to send the Player.Open command to the specified XBMC instance:

Items:

```
String XBMC_OpenMedia    "XBMC Player file [%s]"  { xbmc=">[#woonkamer|Player.Open]" }
Switch XBMC_Radio        "XBMC Start Radio"       
```

Rule:

```
rule "Start Radio"
when
    Item XBMC_Radio changed to ON
then
    postUpdate(XBMC_Radio, OFF)
    sendCommand(XBMC_OpenMedia, "http://icecast.omroep.nl/3fm-bb-mp3")
end
```

This will introduce a Switch item with an associated rule that will send the `Player.Open` command when the switch is pressed. 

### Using Application.Volume option

Item:

```
Dimmer XBMC_Volume "XBMC Volume [%.1f]" (XBMC) { xbmc="=[#woonkamer|Application.Volume]" }
```

Sitemap:

```
Slider item=XBMC_Volume step=10
```

### Setting the Volume from a Rule

```
XBMC_Volume.sendCommand(50)
```

### Using Screensaver.State

Item:

```
Switch LG_Screensaver "XBMC Screensaver Living Room" {xbmc="<[#woonkamer|Screensaver.State]"}
```

Rule:

```
rule "turn tv on or off"
when
    Item LG_Screensaver changed
then
    if(LG_Screensaver.state == ON)
    {
        logInfo("screensaver", "turn tv OFF")
        sendCommand(TV_Power,OFF)
    } else {
        logInfo("screensaver", "turn tv ON")
        sendCommand(TV_Power,ON)
    }
end
```

### Using PVR.OpenTV

Item:

```
String LG_OpenTVChannel "Open TV Channel [%s]"  { xbmc=">[#woonkamer|PVR.OpenTV]" }
```

Rule:

```
rule "Voice Command open tv channel"
 when
    Item VoiceCommand received command
 then
    sendCommand(LG_OpenTVChannel,VoiceCommand.state.toString)
end
```
