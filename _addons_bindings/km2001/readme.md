# KM200 Binding

The KM200 Binding is communicating with a [Buderus Logamatic web KM200 / KM100 / KM50](https://www.buderus.de/de/produkte/catalogue/alle-produkte/7719_gateway-logamatic-web-km200-km100-km50).  It is possible to receive and send parameters like string or float values.

**Important**: If the communication is not working and you see in the logfile errors like "illegal key size" then you have to change the [Java Cryptography Extension to the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html). 


## Binding Configuration

This binding can be configured in the file `services/km200.cfg`.

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| ip4_address |      |   Yes    | IP address of KN200 to connect to |
| PrivKey  |         |   No     | a complete private key, for example `0000FFFFEEEEDDDDCCCCBBBBAAAA999988887777666655554444333322221111`.  If you do not have one, use the following three configuration properties |
| MD5Salt  |         | if you do not have `PrivKey` | the md5salt value, for example `111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0000` |
| GatewayPassword |  | if you do not have `PrivKey` | the device password, for example `AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD` |
| PrivatePassword |  | if you do not have `PrivKey` | the private password, for example `MYPASSWORD` |

## Item Configuration

There are two different ways to configure the items.

### 1. Direct access with defined key

```
DateTime  budDate	"Buderus Date Time [%1$tA, %1$td.%1$tm.%1$tY]" {km200="date_time"}
DateTime  budDate	"Buderus Datum [%1$td.%1$tm.%1$tY %1$tH:%1$tM]" {km200="date_time"}
String  budBrand "Brand of the heater [%s]" {km200="sys_brand"}
String  budType "Type of the heater [%s]" {km200="sys_type"}
String  budStatus "State of the heater [%s]" {km200="sys_state"}
String  budFirmware "Firmwareversion [%s]" {km200="ver_firmware"}
String  budHardware  "Hardwareversion [%s]" {km200="ver_hardware"}
```

### 2. List of avalible services

The second way is the definition of user-defined items with direct path to the services. Here you need to know which kind of services is your device supports. This information you will get from this binding.

* Put the correct configuration in the `services/km200.cfg` file.
* Now you have to start openHAB and take a look in the `openhab.log` file.
* Here you will see after one or two minutes after start, a table with all supported services and capabilities. It looks like this:

```text
readable;writeable;recordable;virtual;type;service;value;allowed;min;max
1;0;1;0;floatValue;/heatSources/nominalDHWPower;15.0;;;
1;1;1;0;floatValue;/dhwCircuits/dhw1/setTemperature;60.0;;30.0;80.0
1;0;0;0;switchProgram;/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/Nachmittag;;;
1;0;1;0;floatValue;/heatingCircuits/hc2/pumpModulation;0.0;;0.0;100.0
1;0;0;0;stringValue;/heatingCircuits/hc4/status;INACTIVE;INACTIVE|ACTIVE;;
```

You can copy this table in a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel. It is ';' seperated.

The colums are:

| Property     |  Description     |
| ------------- |  --------------- |
| readable | Service is readable, if not then you cannot use it |
| writable | It is possible to set values |
| recordable | It is possible to create recordings. Not directly supported yet |
| virtual | This service is only virtual and not existing of the device. The binding is translating the message to the parent |
| type | FloatValue, stringValue, switchProgram (not supported), refEnum ( not relevant), yRecording (not supported) |
| service | This is the path for the configuration |
| value | Value of the service in the time of the init |
| allowed | If existing then only this values are possible |
| min | The min value for a float |
| max | The max value for a float |

You can select this services in the config with the syntax: service: `<fullPathToService>`

## Switching Programs

The binding now supports the reading and changing of switching programs.

The communication between the binding and the user is done over virtual services. In the service list are now virtual services included. Every switch program service has now five virtual subservices. They are:

| Subservice|  Description     |
| ------------- |  --------------- |
| weekday | Selection of a weekday, possible: Mo/Tu/We/Th/Fr/Sa/Su |
| nbrCycles | The number of cycles (on+off or day+night, depends on the parent service) on the selected day |
| cycle | Selection of a cycle on the selected day |
| on/day | The selected switch time for the on/day type of the selected cycle |
| off/night | The selected switch time for the off/night type of the selected cycle |

### Add a new switch cycle

With the last commit it's possible to add a switch cycle to the end of the cycle list. 

* Set a weekday. 
* Set the cycle to the one after the number of actual cycles.
* Set the time for the new on/day type, it will by automaticly moved to the first possible time.
* Set the time for the new off/night type, it will by automaticly moved to the first possible time.


### Remove a switch cycle

With the last commit it's possible to remove a switch cycle from the end of the cycle list. 

* Set a weekday. 
* Set the cycle to the last one.
* Set the time for the off/night type to max time (1430 Minutes).
* Set the time for the on/day type to max time (1430 Minutes).
* Some seconds later it will be removed.

##Error Lists

The binding supports the parsing of the device error list. This list is usally readable from the /notification service. 

This has now new subservices:

| Subservice|  Description     |
| ------------- |  --------------- |
| nbrErrors | The number of errors |
| error| Selection of the error for generation of the errorString 
| errorString | String with all informations about this error

## Dynamic service path (Parameter replacement)

In some cases the path to the service not static. It depends on something else like another service. One example for this are switching programs. It is nice to see switch points parameters from the current selected program.

This binding is supporting parameter replacements. It meens that's possible to replace a part of the service path with a values from another service. 

| Parameter|  Replacement|
| ------------- |  --------------- |
| `__current__` | `current:<path>`|

## Examples

```
String  budState "State of the heating [%s]"  {km200="service:/system/healthStatus"}
Number	budTemp  "Temperature heating night [%.1f Â°C]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc3/temperatureLevels/night"}
```

For switches, you can define which of the allowed values is the one for 'on' and 'off'.

```
Switch  budMode  "Mode [%s]" { km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc3/operationMode on:auto off:night" }
```

Switching programs: (you have to select as first the day, second the cycle and then read/write on/day or off/night).

```
String actBudDayHC1 "Day HC1 [%s]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/Eigen1/weekday" }/Number nbrBudNbrCyclesHC1 "Cycles HC1 [%d]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/Eigen1/nbrCycles" }/Number actBudCycleHC1 "Selected cycle HC1 [%d]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/Eigen1/cycle" }/Number actBudPosHC1 "Day  HC1  [%d]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/Eigen1/day" }/Number actBudNegHC1"Night HC1  [%d]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/Eigen1/night" }/
Number nbrBudNbrCyclesHCT1Curr "Current HC1 [%d]" {km200="service:/heatingCircuits/hc1/switchPrograms/__current__/nbrCycles current:/heatingCircuits/hc1/actualSwitchingProgram" 
```

## Supported item types 

| Item Type|  KM200 service type|
| ------------- |  --------------- |
| Number |  For string, float and switching program (cycle, nbrCycles, on/day, off/night) | 
| String |  For string, float and switching program (weekday)) | 
| DateTime | For string and switching program (on/day, off/night) |
| Switch | For string |


This binding is automaticly blocking the values to the allowed and limiting them to the min and max capabilities.
