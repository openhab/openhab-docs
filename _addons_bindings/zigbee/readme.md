# ZigBee Binding

The ZigBee binding supports an interface to a wireless ZigBee home automation network and allows ZigBee devices from numerous manufacturers to be used without a system specific gateway.

## Supported Things

### Coordinators

A ZigBee Coordinator is the network controller, and is therefore the heart of the ZigBee network. It also acts as the trust centre to control security access to the network.

Coordinators need to be installed manually and the serial port and baud rate must be set. These are set to match the configuration that the dongle is in. Should you wish to use a different baud rate than the default speed of the device, you must change the configuration of the dongle using some other, and then configure the binding to match your change. If in doubt, you should leave the settings at their default values which should work in most cases.

The following coordinators are known to be supported.

| Name and Link              | Coordinator | Comment                       |

#### TI2531 Coordinator

This is the Texas Instruments ZNP stack. The thing type is ```coordinator_ti2351```.

##### TI2531 - Firmware

The TI2531 USB dongle must be flashed with the correct firmware in order to work with this binding.
The file can be downloaded from TI website archives (http://www.ti.com/tool/z-stack-archive) as part
of the `Z-STACK-HOME v.1.2.2a` package.
The file name is `CC2531ZNP-Pro-Secure_Standard.hex` and its sha256 is `3cc5dc571ef0f49e3f42c6c2ca076d6f8fef33a945c71e6f951b839ba0599d3c`.

##### Flashing on Linux

It's possible to flash the dongle using Linux, using `cc-tool` (https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool.git).
The software has been tested and confirmed working on Ubuntu 16.10 and 17.04.
The required dependencies can be installed with `sudo apt install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev libboost-all-dev`, and the binary compiled with `./configure && make`. Do not forget to install the `udev` rules, as described at https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool/blob/master/README , or the software might not be able to access the USB programmer.

The firmware can be flashed with `./cc-tool -e -w CC2531ZNP-Pro-Secure_Standard.hex -v r`. Change the path to the firmware accordingly.


#### Ember EZSP NCP Coordinator

The Ember EZSP NCP (Network Co-Processor) supports the Silabs EM358 or MightyGecko dongles with the standard NCP firmware. The thing type is ```coordinator_ember```.

Note that there are generally two versions of the Ember NCP firmware in use. One operates at a baud rate of 115200 with RTS/CTS flow control (i.e. hardware flow control), the other operates at a baud rate of 57600, and XON/XOFF flow control (i.e. software flow control). If you are programming your own stick (e.g. the CEL stick) then it should be advisable to use the hardware flow control version - many commercial sticks seem to use the lower speed and software flow control (e.g. Bitron and Nortek HUSBZB-1).

#### Telegesis ETRX3

The thing type is ```coordinator_telegesis```.

#### XBee XU-Z11 Coordinator

The thing type is ```coordinator_xbee```.

### Devices

The following devices have been tested with the binding

Note 1: Some bulbs may not work with the Telegesis dongle.

## Discovery

Once the binding is installed, and an adapter is added, it automatically reads all devices that are set up on the ZigBee controller and puts them in the Inbox. When the binding is put into discovery mode via the user interface, the network will have join enabled for 60 seconds.

The binding will store the list of devices that have joined the network locally between restarts to allow them to be found again later. A ZigBee coordinator does not store a list of known devices, so rediscovery of devices following a restart may not be seemless if the dongle is moved to another system.

When a ZigBee device restarts (e.g. a bulb is powered on), it will send an announcement to advise the coordinator that it is on the network and this will allow the binding to rediscover devices that have become lost. Battery devices often have a button that may also perform this function.

## Leave

When a thing is deleted, the binding will attempt to remove the device from the network by sending the *leave* command on the network. 

## Thing Configuration

The binding will attempt to automatically detect new devices, giving them a type based on the information they report, and will read their supported clusters to define the supported channels. 

### Thing Types

Currently all ZigBee things have the same thing type of ```zigbee_device```.

### Channel Types

A set of channels will be created depending on what clusters and endpoints a device supports. Channels are loosely linked to clusters in that for the majority of channels, a single cluster is used. However, some channels may utilise more than one cluster to provide the required functionality.

The following channels are supported -:

| Channel UID | ZigBee Cluster | Type     |Description                  |
|-------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| battery-level | ```POWER_CONFIGURATION``` (0x0001) | Number |   |
| battery_voltage | ```POWER_CONFIGURATION``` (0x0001) | Number |   |
| color_color | ```COLOR_CONTROL``` (0x0300) | Color |   |
| color_temperature | ```COLOR_CONTROL``` (0x0300) | Dimmer |   |
| electrical_activepower | ```ELECTRICAL_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0B04) | Number |   |
| electrical_rmscurrent | ```ELECTRICAL_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0B04)  | Number |   |
| electrical_rmsvoltage | ```ELECTRICAL_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0B04)  | Number |   |
| ias_codetector | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500)  | Switch |   |
| ias_contactportal1 | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500) | Switch |  |
| ias_fire | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500)  | Switch |   |
| ias_motionintrusion | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500) | Switch |  |

| ias_standard_system | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500) | Switch |  |
| measurement_illuminance | ```ILLUMINANCE_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0400) | Number |   |
| measurement_pressure | ```PRESSURE_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0403) | Number |   |
| measurement_relativehumidity | ```RELATIVE_HUMIDITY_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0405) | Number |   |
| measurement_temperature | ```TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0402) | Number:Temperature |   |
| sensor_occupancy | ```OCCUPANCY_SENSING``` (0x0406) | Switch  |  |
| switch_dimmer | ```LEVEL_CONTROL``` (0x0008) | Dimmer |   |
| switch_onoff | ```ON_OFF``` (0x0006) | Switch  |


### Updates

The binding will attempt to configure a connection with the device to receive automatic and instantaneous reports when the device status changes. Should this configuration fail, the binding will resort to using a fast polling (note that "fast" is approximately 30 seconds at this time). 


## When things don't appear to be working

When things don't appear to be working as expected you should check the logs to try and find what is happening. Debug logging can be enabled with the following Karaf commands -:

```
log:set debug org.openhab.binding.zigbee
log:set debug com.zsmartsystems.zigbee
```

This will log data into the standard openhab.log file.

Note that logs can only show what is happening at a high level - it can't show all data exchanges between the device and the coordinator - just what the coordinator sends to the binding. For this reason it can be difficult to debug issues where devices are not joining the network, or other low level issues need resolving. In such cases a network sniffer log is required, which requires additional hardware and software.
