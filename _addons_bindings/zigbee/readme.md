# ZigBee Binding

The ZigBee binding supports an interface to a wireless ZigBee home automation network. 

## Supported Things

### Coordinators

Coordinators need to be installed manually and the serial port must be set.

#### TI2531 Coordinator

This is the Texas Instruments ZNP stack. The thing type is ```coordinator_ti2351```.

##### TI2531 - Firmware

The TI2531 USB dongle must be flashed with the correct firmware in order to work with this binding.
The file can be downloaded from TI website archives (http://www.ti.com/tool/z-stack-archive) as part
of the `Z-STACK-HOME v.1.2.2a` package.
The file name is `CC2531ZNP-Pro-Secure_Standard.hex` and its sha256 is `3cc5dc571ef0f49e3f42c6c2ca076d6f8fef33a945c71e6f951b839ba0599d3c`.

##### Flashing on Linux

It's possible to flash the dongle using Linux, using `cc-tool` (https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool.git).
The software has been tested and confirmed working on Ubuntu 16.10 and 17.04.
The required dependencies can be installed with `sudo apt install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev libboost-all-dev`, and the binary compiled with `./configure && make`. Do not forget to install the `udev` rules, as described at https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool/blob/master/README , or the software might not be able to access the USB programmer.

The firmware can be flashed with `./cc-tool -e -w CC2531ZNP-Pro-Secure_Standard.hex -v r`. Change the path to the firmware accordingly.


#### Ember EZSP NCP Coordinator

The Ember EZSP NCP (Network Co-Processor) supports the Silabs EM358 or MightyGecko dongles with the standard NCP firmware. The thing type is ```coordinator_ember```.

#### Telegesis ETRX3

The thing type is ```coordinator_telegesis```.

### Devices

The following devices have been tested with the binding

| Device                     | Description                    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Busch-Jaegar 6711          | Relay Insert                   |
| Hue Bulbs                  | Color LED Bulb                 |
| Hue Motion Sensor          | Motion and Luminance sensor    |
| Osram Bulbs                |                                |
| SmartThings Plug           | Metered Plug                   |
| SmartThings Motion Sensor  | Motion and Temperature sensor  |
| SmartThings Contact Sensor | Contact and Temperature sensor |
| Tradfri Bulbs              |                                |



## Discovery

Once the binding is authorized, and an adapter is added, it automatically reads all devices that are set up on the ZigBee controller and puts them in the Inbox. When the binding is put into discovery mode, the network will have join enabled for 60 seconds.


## Thing Configuration

The binding will attempt to automatically detect new devices, giving them a type based on their information they report, and will read their supported clusters to define the supported channels. 

### Thing Types

Currently all ZigBee things have the same thing type of ```zigbee_device```.

### Channel Types

A set of channels will be created depending on what clusters and endpoints a device supports. Channels are loosely linked to clusters in that for the majority of channels, a single cluster is used. However, some channels may utilise more than one cluster to provide the required functionality.

The following channels are supported -:

| Channel UID | ZigBee Cluster | Type     |Description                  |
|-------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| switch_dimmer | ```LEVEL_CONTROL``` (0x0008) | Dimmer |   |
| switch_onoff | ```ON_OFF``` (0x0006) | Switch  |
| color_color | ```COLOR_CONTROL``` (0x0300) | Color |   |
| color_temperature | ```COLOR_CONTROL``` (0x0300) | Dimmer |   |
| ias_contactportal1 | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500) | Switch |  |
| ias_motionintrusion | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500) | Switch |  |
| ias_motionpresence | ```IAS_ZONE``` (0x0500) | Switch |  |
| measurement_illuminance | ```ILLUMINANCE_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0400) | Number |   |
| measurement_temperature | ```TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT``` (0x0402) | Number |   |
| sensor_occupancy   | ```OCCUPANCY_SENSING``` (0x0406) | Switch  |  |
