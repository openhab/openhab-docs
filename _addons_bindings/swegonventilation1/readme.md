# Swegon Ventilation Binding 

This binding is used to get live data from Swegon ventilation systems into items in openHAB. It should be compatible with at least Swegon CASA models.

## Prerequisites

`swegongw` is an application that reads packets from a serial port (an RS-485 adapter is needed) and relays them to openHAB via UDP. The Swegon Ventilation binding listens on the UDP port and extracts control data from UDP packets.

C code is available [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/blob/master/bundles/binding/org.openhab.binding.swegonventilation/SwegonGW/swegongw.c).

Build: 

```
gcc -std=gnu99 -o swegongw swegongw.c
```

Run:

```
swegongw -h 
swegongw -v -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -a 192.168.1.10
```

## Binding Configuration

This binding can be configured in the file `services/swegonventilation.cfg`.

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| udpPort  | 9998    |    No    | UDP port on which the binding will listen |

## Item Configuration

Format:

```
    swegonventilation="<data>"
```

Where `<data>` identifies a datum to retrieve:

| `<data>`                     | Item Type | Purpose                     | Note |
