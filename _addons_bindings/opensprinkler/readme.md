# OpenSprinkler Binding

This binding allows allows basic control of the OpenSprinkler and OpenSprinkler PI (Plus) devices.
Stations can be controlled to be turned on or off and rain sensor state can be read.

## Supported Things

*   OpenSprinkler using the HTTP API access on the network.
*   OpenSprinkler PI (Plus) through the GPIO when openHAB is installed on the same Raspberry Pi used in the OpenSprinkler PI.

## Discovery

OpenSprinkler devices can be manually discovered by sending a request to every IP on the network.
Discovery needs to be run manually as this is a brute force method of finding devices that can saturate network or device available bandwidth.

## Thing Configuration

OpenSprinkler

```
opensprinkler:http:1 [ hostname="127.0.0.1", port=80, password="opendoor", refresh=60 ]
```

-   hostname: Hostname or IP address of the OpenSprinkler HTTP API.
-   port: Port the OpenSprinkler device is listening on. Usually 80.
-   password: Admin password of the API. Factory default is: opendoor
-   refresh: Number of seconds in between refreshing the Thing state with the API.

OpenSprinkler PI

```
opensprinkler:pi:1 [ stations=8, refresh=60 ]
```

-   stations: Number of stations to control.
-   refresh: Number of seconds in between refreshing the Thing state with the API.

## Channels

The following channels are supported by all devices.
