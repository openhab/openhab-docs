# Logitech Squeezebox Binding

This binding integrates the [Logitech Media Server](http://www.mysqueezebox.com) and compatible Squeeze players.

## Introduction

Slim Devices was established in 2000, and was first known for its SlimServer used for streaming music, but launched a hardware player named SliMP3 able to play these streams in 2001. Although the first player was fairly simple only supporting wired Ethernet and MP3 natively, it was followed two years later by a slightly more advanced player which was renamed to Squeezebox. Other versions followed, gradually adding native support for additional file formats, Wi-Fi-support, gradually adding larger and more advanced displays as well as a version targeting audiophile users. Support for playing music from external streaming platforms such as Pandora, Napster, Last.fm and Sirius were also added. The devices in general have two operating modes; either standalone where the device connects to an internet streaming service directly, or to a local computer running the Logitech Media Server or a network-attached storage device. Both the server software and large parts of the firmware on the most recent players are released under open source licenses.

In 2006, Slim Devices was acquired by Logitech for $20 million USD. Logitech continued the development of the player until they announced in August 2012 that it would be discontinued. Given the cross-platform nature of the server and software client, some users have ensured the continued use of the platform by utilizing the Raspberry Pi as dedicated Squeezebox device (both client and server).

## Supported Things

At least one Squeeze Server is required to act as a bridge for Squeeze players on the network.  Squeeze players may be official Logitech products or other players like [Squeeze Lites](https://code.google.com/p/squeezelite/).

## Discovery

A Squeeze Server is discovered through UPnP in the local network. Once it is added as a Thing the Squeeze Server bridge will discover Squeeze Players automatically. 

## Binding Configuration

The binding requires no special configuration

## Thing Configuration

The Squeeze Server bridge requires the ip address, web port, and cli port to access it on.  If Squeeze Server authentication is enabled, the userId and password also are required.
Squeeze Players are identified by their MAC address.
In the thing file, this looks e.g. like

```
Bridge squeezebox:squeezeboxserver:myServer [ ipAddress="192.168.1.10", webport=9000, cliport=9090 ]
{
    Thing squeezeboxplayer myplayer[ mac="00:f1:bb:00:00:f1" ]
}
```

Or, if Squeeze Server authentication is enabled:

```
Bridge squeezebox:squeezeboxserver:myServer [ ipAddress="192.168.1.10", webport=9000, cliport=9090, userId="yourid", password="yourpassword" ]
{
    Thing squeezeboxplayer myplayer[ mac="00:f1:bb:00:00:f1" ]
}
```

## Channels

## Notifications

### How To Set Up

Squeeze Players can be set up as audio sinks in openHAB.  Please follow the [openHAB multimedia documentation](http://docs.openhab.org/configuration/multimedia.html) for setup guidance. 

You can create an item and sitemap entry in order to set the notification volume independently from the Squeeze Player's current volume setting. If the notification volume is not specified, it will use the Player's current volume setting.

Item for setting notification volume.

```
Dimmer NotificationVolume "Notification Volume [%d %%]" {channel="squeezebox:squeezeboxplayer:5919BEA2-764B-4590-BC70-D74DCC15491B:20cfbf221510:notificationSoundVolume"}
```

Sitemap entry for setting notification volume.

```
Slider item=NotificationVolume label="Notification Volume"
```

You can play notifications from within rules.

```
rule "Garage Door Open Notification"
when
    Item GarageDoorOpenNotification received command ON
then
    // Play the notification on the default sink
    say("The garage door is open!", "voicerss:enUS")
    // Play the notification on a specific sink
    say("The garage door is open!", "voicerss:enUS", "squeezebox:squeezeboxplayer:5919BEA2-764B-4590-BC70-D74DCC15491B:20cfbf221510")
end
```

And, you can play sounds from the conf/sounds directory.

```
rule "Play Sounds"
when
    Item PlaySounds received command ON
then
    // Play the sound on the default sink
    playsound("doorbell.mp3")
    // Play the sound on a specific sink
    playsound("squeezebox:squeezeboxplayer:5919BEA2-764B-4590-BC70-D74DCC15491B:20cfbf221510", "doorbell.mp3")
end
```

### Known Issues

- There are some versions of squeezelite that will not correctly play very short duration mp3 files.  Versions of squeezelite after v1.7 and before v1.8.6 will not play very short duration mp3 files reliably.  For example, if you're using piCorePlayer (which uses squeezelite), please check your version of squeezelite if you're having trouble playing notifications. This bug has been fixed in squeezelite version 1.8.6-985, which is included in piCorePlayer version 3.20.

- When streaming from a remote service (such as Pandora or Spotify), after the notification plays, the Squeezebox Server starts playing a new track, instead of picking up from where it left off on the currently playing track.
