# NeoHub Binding

The NeoHub binding allows you to connect openhab via TCP/IP to Heatmiser's NeoHub and integrate your NeoStat thermostats onto the bus. 

## Binding Configuration

This binding can be configured in the file `services/neohub.cfg`.

The binding polls each thermostat that is configured in your items, at the _refresh_ rate as set in the configuration. 

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| refresh  | 60000   |   No     | Refresh interval in milliseconds |
| hostname |         |   Yes    | the NeoHub network address |
| port     | 4242    |   No     | the port number for the NeoHub interface |

## Item Configuration

Item strings simply consist of two components - the NeoStat device name (as set in the thermostat and in the mobile app, e.g. Office), and the NeoStat property (e.g. CurrentTemperature). Both parameters are only separated by a colon. Some examples are below.

```
Switch Heating_Office       "Heating Office"         {neohub="Office:Heating"}
Switch Away_Office          "Away Office"            {neohub="Office:Away"}
Switch Standby_Office       "Standby Office"         {neohub="Office:Standby"}
Number Temperature_Office   "Temperature [%.1f Â°C]"  {neohub="Office:CurrentTemperature"}
```

The following properties, and their associated item types are shown below. The R and RW in the description column indicate which properties are read only (RO) or read/write (RW).

| Property     | Type Supported   | Description     |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| CurrentTemperature       | Number | RO Current room temperature |
| CurrentSetTemperature       | Number | RO Current set temperature |
| CurrentFloorTemperature     | Number | RO Current floor temperature |
| DeviceName      | String   | RO  Returns the device name |
| Heating     | Switch, String   | RO Returns ON or OFF if heating is currently enabled or not |
| Away      | Switch, String | RW Returns ON or OFF if thermostat is in away mode or not |
| Standby   | Switch, String | RW Returns ON or OFF if thermostat is in standby mode or not |
