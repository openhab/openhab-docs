# Tellstick Binding

This binding is tested against Tellstick DUO, it should also work with a basic Tellstick.  It supports RF 433 Mhz protocols like: Nexa, HomeEasy, X10, CoCo (KlikAanKlikUit), Oregon e.o.

See further information from http://www.telldus.com

The binding supports sensors (temperature and humidity) and devices (switches, dimmers and dimmers without an absolute level).

There is also a binding specifically for openHAB 2 [here](http://docs.openhab.org/addons/bindings/tellstick/readme.html).

## Prerequisites

First of all you need to make sure that your JVM is matching your installed Telldus Center. 

This normally means OpenHab must run on a 32bit JVM for windows and a 64bit JVM for linux.

For Windows, the binding is hardcoded to look for Telldus Center in Programs Files ("C:/Program Files/Telldus/;C:/Program Files (x86)/Telldus/").

You will have to use Telldus Center to add all your devices. It is also easiest to find the sensor ID by using the Telldus Center. To configure a device, you need the name and type of device, to configure a sensor you need the ID and Type of sensor. I recommend using `tdtool -l` to list all your devices and sensors. Run openHAB in DEBUG mode to see that everything starts up correctly and that you are receiving sensor/device updates.

## Binding Configuration

The binding can be configured in the file `services/tellstick.cfg`.

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| library_path |     |   No     | Set to the local folder of the `tellduscore.dll` or `tellduscore.so` if you have trouble getting the telldus core library to work. |
| max_idle |         |   No     | If you don't have a Tellstick Duo or the number of device events is less than 1 every 10 minutes you should increase this value to a higher number like 600000 |

## Item Configuration

The format for devices is:

```
tellstick="<deviceName>:<deviceType>:[<specialCase>][<resendCount>]"
```

where:

* `<deviceName>` matches the name in Telldus Center.  
* `<deviceType>` is either `Command` for on/off or `DimmingLevel` for absolute dimmable device.
* `<specialCase>` is used for the dimmable without absolute level (devices that are dimmable with clicking twice). For this case use `Dimmable`
* `<resendCount>` is just the number of times to resend command.

The item configuration for a sensor is:

```  
tellstick="<sensorId>:<valueType>:[<useValueType>]:[<protocol>]
```

where:

* `<sensorId>` is the sensorId taken from Telldus Center or debug logs.  
* `<valueType>` is either `Temperatur` or `Humidity`, based on sensor.  
* `<useValueType>` is for special cases where the value in `<valueType>` is actually something else, supports `BatteryLevel` (`Humidity:BatteryLevel`) and `Motion` (`Temperature:Motion`). This is implemented for homemade temp/humid and motion sensors (see the [Forum](http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=63772&hilit=telldus)).
* `<protocol>` if you have multiple sensors with same ID you might need to specify the protocol to make it unique

## Examples

### Basic Items

Switch:

```
Switch  GF_Dining_Aquarium "Aquarium" <aquarium> { tellstick="Aquarium:Command" }
```

Dimmer without absolute (dims when clicking **on** button twice):

```   
Switch  GF_Kitchen_Wall "Wall"  { tellstick="Kitchen Backwall:Command:Dimmable:1" }
```

Temp sensor:

```
Number  GF_Kitchen_Temp "Temperature [%.1f °C]" <temperature> { tellstick="14:Temperature" }
```

Temp sensor with protocol defined:

```
Number      GF_Temp "Temperature [%.1f °C]" <temperature> { tellstick="21:Temperature:Temperature:oregon" }﻿
```

Wind sensor

```
Number      Outside_Wind_Avg "Wind Average [%d]"  <wind>  { tellstick="22:WindAvg" }﻿                  
```

Battery Level

```
Number  GF_Kitchen_Battery "Battery [%d]" <battery> { tellstick="82:Humidity:BatteryLevel" }
```

### Using the Python library Instead of this Binding

Below is an example of how to capture events from Telldus Tellstick and forward them to the openHAB bus as events through REST. The example works for on/off switches and wireless sensors but can easily be extended to dimmers, etc. Events are sent to openhab regardless if a telldus state change originates from a wireless remote or from other software (e. g. Switchking or Telldus Center). In other words, the script keeps openHAB in sync with telldus states.

You need:

- Tellstick Duo (RF Transmitter/Receiver)
- [Telldus Core software](http://developer.telldus.se/)
- [Tellcore Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tellcore-py)

Tested on Ubuntu Server 13.04.
