# Tellstick Binding

This is an openHAB binding for Tellstick devices produced by Telldus, a Swedish company based in Lund.

The original Tellstick focused on controlling 433 MHz devices like switches, dimmers and reading sensors from different brands.
Many of the supported devices are cheaper and "low-end" and support have been made by reverse engineer the transmission protocols.
All of these 433 MHz devices is one-way, so some versions of the Tellstick monitoring the air to keep the state of all devices.

The latest versions have also implemented Z-Wave as transmission protocol which open up for more robust transmission due two-ways communication.

## Supported Things

This binding supports the following thing types:

*   *Dimmable Device* - Usually for controlling lamps.  `dimmer`
*   *Switchable Device* - On/Off only could be lamps or other electronic equipment. `switch`
*   *Sensors* - Temperature- and humidity-sensors. `sensor`

Additionally the binding have two types of bridge things which correspond to available API types:

*   *Telldus Core Bridge* - Oldest API, used by USB devices. `telldus-core`
*   *Telldus Live Bridge* - Telldus Cloud service, all devices with online access. `telldus-live`

The attentive reader discovers that there is many missing sensor types; `UV`, `Luminance`, `Dew point`, `Barometic pressure` `Rainrate`, `Raintotal`, `Winddirection`, `Windaverage` and `Windgust` which is supported by the Tellstick devices.
Support have not been implemented on the openhab side yet, contributions are welcome.  

***Switchbased sensors workaround*** <br>
*   Some 433MHz magnetic & PIR sensors, for example, magnetic door sensors, are detected as regular `switch` Things instead of type `contact`. There is technically no way of distinguish them apart from regulur `switch` Things.
For using them as sensors only (not paired to a lamp) please consult the workaround in the channel section.

## Discovery

Devices which is added to *Telldus Core* and *Telldus Live* can be discovered by openHAB.

When you add this binding it will try to discover the *Telldus Core Bridge*.
If it's installed correct its devices will show up.
If you want to use the *Telldus Live* its bridge, *Telldus Live bridge* need to be added manually.

## Binding Configuration

The binding itself requires no configuration.

## Thing Configuration

Only the bridges require manual configuration.
It is preferable that devices and sensors are discovered automatically; let the discovery/inbox initially configure them. 
You can add them either with karaf: `inbox approve <thingId>` or by using the inbox of the Paper UI.

### Dimmers & switches

There is an option to override the resend count of the commands.
Use the option `repeat` for that. Default resend count is 2.

### Bridges

Depending on your tellstick device type there is different ways of using this binding.
The binding implements two different API:  
**1)** *Telldus Core* which is a local only interface supported by USB based device. <br>
**2)** *Telldus Live* which is a REST based cloud service maintained by Telldus. <br>

> Not implemented yet but supported by some new devices, contributions are welcome. [API documention.](http://api.telldus.net/localapi/api.html) <br>
> **3)** *Local Rest API* is a local API which would work similar to Telldus Live but local.

Depending on your Tellstick model, different bridge-types are available:

<table>
<tr><td><b>Model</b></td> <td><b>Telldus Core</b></td> <td><b>Telldus Live</b></td> <td>Local REST API</td> <td><b>Verified working with openHAB</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tellstick Basic</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tellstick Duo</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tellstick Net v.1</td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tellstick Net v.2</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tellstick ZNet Lite v.1</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tellstick ZNet Lite v.2</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

#### Telldus Core Bridge

> To enable communication between openhab and tellstick-core service (Telldus center) they must use same architecture, eg. 32-bit or 64-bit. The supplied version from Telldus is compiled against 32-bit architecture. Therefore, it is better to use 32-bit java for openHAB. To check which version of Java is currently in use, run: `java -d32 -version`
>
> *For changing architecture in linux check out: `dpkg --add-architecture`* 

The telldus-core bridge uses a library on the local computer which is a `.dll` file for Windows and a `.so` file for Linux. The default one is usually correct.

```
Bridge tellstick:telldus-core:1 "Tellstick Duo" [resendInterval=200,libraryPath="C:/Program Files/Telldus/;C:/Program Files (x86)/Telldus/"]
```

Optional:

-   **libraryPath:** The path to tellduscore.dll/so semicolon seperated list of folders.
-   **resendInterval:** The interval between each transmission of command in ms, default 100ms.

#### Telldus Live Bridge

To configure Telldus Live you have request OAuth tokens from Telldus. Goto this page
<http://api.telldus.com/keys/index> and request your keys and update the config.

```
Bridge tellstick:telldus-live:2 "Tellstick ZWave" [publicKey="XXX", privateKey="YYYY", token= "ZZZZ", tokenSecret="UUUU"]
```

Required:

-   **privateKey:** Private key
-   **publicKey:** Public key
-   **token:** Token
-   **tokenSecret:** Token secret

Optional:

-   **refreshInterval:** How often we should contact *Telldus Live* to check for updates (in ms)

## Channels

Actuators (dimmer/switch) support the following channels:

<table>
<tr><td><b>Channel Type ID</b></td> <td><b>Item Type</b></td> <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td>dimmer</td><td>Number</td><td>This channel indicates the current dim level</td></tr>
<tr><td>state</td><td>Switch</td><td>This channel indicates whether a device is turned on or off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>timestamp</td><td>DateTime</td><td>This channel reports the last time this device state changed.</td></tr>
</table>

Sensors (sensor) support the following channels:

<table>
<tr><td><b>Channel Type ID</b></td> <td><b>Item Type</b></td> <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td>humidity</td><td>Number</td><td>This channel reports the current humidity in percentage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>temperature</td><td>Number</td><td>This channel reports the current temperature in celsius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>timestamp</td><td>DateTime</td><td> This channel reports the last time this sensor was updates.</td></tr>
</table>

### Switchbased sensor workaround

All switchbased sensors are binary and the goal is to represent them as a `contact` item in openhab. Eg. a door is open or closed and can't be altered by sending a radio signal.
To achive that we will create a proxy item which is updated by a rule.


First create another proxy item for every sensor:

```
Switch front_door_sensor	"Front door"  <door>  {channel="tellstick:switch:1:7:state"}
Contact front_door_proxy	"Front door"  <door>
```

Then create a rule which updates the proxy item:

```
rule "proxy_front_door_on"
when
	Item front_door_sensor changed to ON
then
	postUpdate(front_door_proxy, OPEN);		
end

rule "proxy_front_door_off"
when
	Item front_door_sensor changed to OFF
then
	postUpdate(front_door_proxy, CLOSED);		
end
```

```

### tellstick.items

```
