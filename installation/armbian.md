## Supported images

You can [download](https://www.armbian.com/download/?device_support=Supported) and use server, desktop or minimal. If you choose a minimal image, you need to install armbian-config first.

## Setup

**First Steps:**

1. Prepare Armbian as usual - [login as root / 1234, change root password, create username. You don't need to perform any other steps](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/).

2. Update

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

3. Run armbian-config

```shell

Wait 5 to 10 minutes depending on your hardware. During this time you can leave armbian-config and check if installation was succesfull by checking what openhab is doing on the system:

```shell
sudo htop -u openhab
```

If you don't see any openhab activities, something went wrong.
