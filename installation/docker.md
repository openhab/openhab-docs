# Installation through Docker

## Usage

**Important** To be able to use UPnP for discovery the container needs to be started with ``--net=host``.

The following will run openHAB in demo mode on the host machine:
```
docker run -it --name openhab --net=host openhab/openhab:amd64-online server
```

**NOTE** Although this is the simplest method to getting openHAB up and running, but it is not the preferred method. To properly run the container, please specify a **host volume** for the ``conf`` and ``userdata`` directory:


```
docker run \
        --name openhab \
        --net=host \
        -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
        -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
        -v /opt/openhab/conf:/openhab/conf \
        -v /opt/openhab/userdata:/openhab/userdata \
        -d \
        --restart=always \
        openhab/openhab:amd64-online
```

or with ``docker-compose.yml``
```

openhab:
  image: 'openhab/openhab:amd64-online'
  restart: always
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    - "8443:8443"
    - "5555:5555"
  net: "host"

  command: "server"
```
then start with ``docker-compose up -d``

**Accessing the console**
``docker exec -it openhab console``

**Debug Mode**

You can start the container with the command ``docker run -it openhab/openhab debug`` to get into the debug shell.

*  `OPENHAB_HTTP_PORT`=8080
*  `OPENHAB_HTTPS_PORT`=8443
