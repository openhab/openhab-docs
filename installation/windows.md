# Installation on Windows

## Installing the openHAB runtime

The openHAB runtime comes as a platform-independent zip file.
To install it, follow these simple steps:

1. You will need to install Java if not already installed. Go to http://java.com/ to get it.
2. Unzip the `openhab-offline-<version>.zip` to where it is intended to be running from, e.g. `C:\openhab`.  Note that there can't be a space in the path, so it can't be in program files in windows.


## Start the server!

1. Launch the runtime by executing the script `start.bat`


## Go test it!

openHAB comes with a built-in user interface. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and you should be looking at the openHAB startpage.
