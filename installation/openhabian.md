# openHABian - Hassle-free openHAB Setup

The Raspberry Pi and other small single-board computers are quite famous platforms for openHAB.
However, setting up a fully working Linux system with all recommended packages and openHAB recommendations is a **boring task** taking quite some time and **Linux newcomers** shouldn't worry about these technical details.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic;"><q>A home automation enthusiast doesn't have to be a Linux enthusiast!</q></p>

openHABian aims to provide a **self-configuring** Linux system setup specific to the needs of every openHAB user.
The project provides two things:

* A set of scripts to set up openHAB on any Debian/Ubuntu based system
* Complete **SD-card images pre-configured with openHAB** and many other openHAB- and Hardware-specific preparations, namely for the Raspberry Pi.

### Manual Setup

openHABian also supports general Debian/Ubuntu based systems on different platforms.
Successful installations have been reported for the following platforms and environments:

* **Raspberry Pi Zero:** The RPi0 doesn't have an ethernet port thus is not compatible with the netinstaller method of the openHABianPi image.
  Community member [*jtmoderate876* went the extra mile](https://community.openhab.org/t/oh-on-the-raspberry-pi-zero/10997/15).
  After installing Raspbian, executing openHABian as described below was all that's needed. He's quite happy with the results. 

Starting with a fresh installation of your operating system, install git, then clone the openHABian poject and finally execute the openHABian configuration tool.

```shell
# install git
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

# download and link
sudo git clone https://github.com/openhab/openhabian.git /opt/openhabian
ln -s /opt/openhabian/openhabian-setup.sh /usr/local/bin/openhabian-config

# execute
sudo openhabian-config
```

You'll see the openHABian configuration menu and can now run all desired actions, e.g. install the newest Oracle Java 8 revision or openHAB 2.

> Attention:
> openHABian usage on a custom system is supported but not yet widely tested.
> Please be cautious and have a close look at the console output for errors.
> Report every error you see to the [openHABian Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/issues).


## First Steps

The following instructions are oriented at the Raspberry Pi openHABian setup but are transferable to all openHABian environments.

Once connected to the command line console of your system, please execute the openHABian configuration tool by typing the command `sudo openhabian-config`:

![openHABian-config menu](images/openHABian-config.png)

The configuration tool is the heart of openHABian.
It is not only a menu with a set of options, it's also used in a special unattended mode inside the ready to use images.

Execute the "Update" function before anything else. The menu and the menu options will evolve over time and you should ensure to be up to date.

All other menu entries should be self-explaining and more details are shown after selecting an option.

‚Ñπ - The actions behind menu entry 1-5 are already taken care of on a Raspberry Pi openHABian image installation.

‚å® - A quick note on menu navigation.
Use the cursor keys to navigate, &lt;Enter&gt; to execute, &lt;Space&gt; to select and &lt;Tab&gt; to jump to the actions on the bottom of the screen. Press &lt;Esc&gt; twice to exit the configuration tool.

### Linux Hints

If you are unfamiliar with Linux, SSH and the Linux console or if you want to improve your skills, read up on these important topics.
A lot of helpful articles can be found on the internet, for example:

* "Learn the ways of Linux-fu, for free" interactively with exercises at [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com).
* The official Raspberry Pi help articles over at [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help)
* "Now what?", Tutorial on the Command line console at [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)

*The good news:* openHABian helps you to stay away from Linux - *The bad news:* Not for long.

Regardless of if you want to copy some files or are on the search for a solution to a problem, sooner or later you'll have to know some Linux.
Take a few minutes to study the above Tutorials and get to know the most basic commands and tools to be able to navigate on your Linux system, edit configurations, check the system state or look at log files.
It's not complicated and something that doesn't hurt on ones r√©sum√©.

{: #further-config}
### Further Configuration Steps

openHABian is supposed to provide a ready-to-use openHAB base system. There are however a few things we can not decide for you.

* **Timezone:** The default timezone openHABian is shipped with is "Europe/Berlin". You should change it to your location.
* **Language:** The `locale` setting of the openHABian base system is set to "en_US.UTF-8". While this setting will not do any harm, you might prefer e.g. console errors in german or spanish. Change the locale settings acordingly. Be aware, that error solving might be easier when using the english error messages as search phrases.
* **Passwords:** Relying on default passwords is a security concern you should care about!

{: #timezone-locale}
### Timezone and Locale

To change the timezone for your openHABian system execute the follwing commands:

```shell
# List available timezones
timedatectl list-timezones

# Set system timezone
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Berlin

# Check the result
timedatectl
```

Changing the locale of your system is done by the below commands.
The first command configures the available languges, the second will define the default.
You should leave Englisch as an available language, as not all packages provide error messages in e.g. German.

```shell
# List available locales
cat /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED

# Generate locales, set default
/usr/sbin/locale-gen en_US.UTF-8 de_DE.UTF-8
/usr/sbin/update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

You will need to restart your system for the locale setting to take effect.

{: #passwords}
### Changing your Passwords

The openHABian system is preconfigured with a few passwords you should change to ensure the security of your system.
This is especially important of your system is accessible from outside your private subnet.

Here are the passwords in question, their default value and the way to change them:

* User password needed for SSH or sudo (e.g. "openhabian:openhabian") : `passwd`
* Samba share password (e.g. "openhabian:openhabian"): `sudo smbpasswd openhabian`
* Karaf remote console (e.g. "openhab:habopen"): Change via the openHABian menu
* Nginx reverse proxy login (no default): Change via the openHABian menu, please see [here](http://docs.openhab.org/installation/security.html#adding-or-removing-users) for more

* [https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/issues](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/issues)

{: #faq-image-size}
#### The RPi image is only "64 MB small", is that a typing error?

No. The Raspberry Pi image is based on [raspbian-ua-netinst](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst), which produces a minimal boot system image of that size.

{: #faq-successful}
#### Did my Installation succeed?

During and after the first boot of your Raspberry Pi, the green on-board LED will indicate the setup progress (no display needed):

* `‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ` - Steady "heartbeat": setup **successful**
* `‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ` - Irregular blinking: setup in progress...
* `‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ÄÉ‚ùáÔ∏èÔ∏è` - Fast blinking: error while setup, check `/var/log/raspbian-ua-netinst.log`

Besides that you should always be able to connect to the SSH console of your device.
If the installation was successful, you will see the normal login screen.
If the installation was *not* successful you will see a warning and further instructions:

![openHABian installation failed warning and instructions](images/openHABian-install-failed.png)

If you are not able to SSH access your system after more than one hours, chances are high, that your hardware setup is the problem.
Try using a steady power source and a reliable SD card.
Restart the Setup process to rule out most other possible causes.

Contact the [Community Forum thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/13379) if the problem persists.

{: #switch-openhab-branch}
#### Can I switch from openHAB 2 stable to the testing or unstable branch?

openHABian installs the latest stable build of openHAB 2.
If you want to switch over to the testing/beta or the snapshot release branch, please do so manually on the SSH/Linux console.
Switching from stable to newer development releases might introduce changes and incompatiblities, so please be sure to make a full openHAB backup first!

Check the Linux installation article for all needed details: [Linux: Changing Versions](http://docs.openhab.org/installation/linux.html#changing-versions)

{: #faq-other-platforms}
#### Can I use openHABian on ...?

openHABian is restricted to Debian/Ubuntu based systems.
If your Operating System is one of these or if your Hardware supports one, your chances are high openHABian can be used.
Differences between systems can still be a problem, so please check the [Community Forum thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/13379) or the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/issues) for more information.
Do not hesitate to ask!
