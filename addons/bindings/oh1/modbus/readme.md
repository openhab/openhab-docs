# Modbus Binding

The binding supports both TCP and Serial slaves. RTU, ASCII and BIN variants of Serial Modbus are supported.

The binding can act as 

- Modbus TCP Client (that is, as modbus master), querying data from Modbus TCP servers (that is, modbus slaves).
- Modbus serial master, querying data from modbus serial slaves

The Modbus binding polls the slaves with an configurable poll period. openHAB commands are translated to write requests.

## Binding Configuration

This binding can be configured in the file `services/modbus.cfg`.

### Global configuration

Most of config parameters are related to specific slaves, but some are global and thus affect all slaves.

| Property | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| poll     | 200     |   No     | **Poll period (optional)**<br/> Frequency of polling Modbus slaves. Note that the value is in milliseconds! For example, `poll=1000` makes the binding poll Modbus slaves once per second. |
| writemultipleregisters | false | No | **Function code to use when writing holding registers (optional)**<br/>Binding can be configured to use FC 16 (*Write Multiple Holding Registers*) over FC 6 (*Write Single Holding Register*) when writing holding register items (see above).  This is optional and default is `false`. For example, `writemultipleregisters=true` makes the binding to use FC16 when writing holding registers. |

## Configuration parameters specific to each slave

The slaves are configured using key value pairs in openHAB config file. Each slave (identified by the slave name) in the config corresponds to a single modbus read request. Note that it might be necessary to define many "slaves" in openhab configuration to read all data from a single physical modbus slave.

The configuration parameters have the following pattern:

```ini
<slave-type>.<slave-name>.<slave-parameter-name>=<slave-parameter-value>
```
where
- `<slave-type>` can be either "tcp" or "serial" depending on the type of this Modbus slave
- `<slave-name>` is unique name per slave you are connecting to. Used in openHAB configuration to refer to the slave.
- `<slave-parameter-name>` identifies the parameter to configure
- `<slave-parameter-value>` is the value of the parameter

Valid slave parameters are


<table>
  <tr><td>Property</td><td>Required</td><td>Description</td></tr>
  <tr><td>connection</td><td>mandatory</td>
       <td><p>Connection string for the slave.</p>
           <p><b>TCP slaves</b> use the form <i>host_ip[:port]</i> e.g. <i>192.168.1.55</i> or <i>192.168.1.55:511</i>. If you omit port, default <i>502</i> will be used. </p>
       <p>For <b>serial connections</b> use the form <i>port:[:baud:[dataBits:[parity:[stopBits:[encoding]]]]]</i>, e.g. <i>/dev/ttyS0:38400:8:none:1:rtu</i> (read from <i>/dev/ttyS0</i> using baud rate of 38400, 8 databits, no parity, 1 stopbits, and rtu encoding. Another minimal example is <i>/dev/ttyS0:38400</i> where all optional parameters except baud rate will get their default values.</p>

<p>

### Advanced connection parameters (**since 1.9.0**)

Since 1.9.0 `connection` parameter can take additional colon (:) separated parameters:

- For TCP slave the new format for connection parameter is: <i>host_ip[:port[:interTransactionDelayMillis[:reconnectAfterMillis[:interConnectDelayMillis[:connectMaxTries[:connectTimeout]]]]]]</i>. 
- For the serial slaves the new format is: <i>port[:baud[:dataBits[:parity[:stopBits[:encoding[:interTransactionDelayMillis[:receiveTimeoutMillis[:flowControlIn[:flowControlOut]]]]]]]]</i>

Explanation of these new parameters

- `interTransactionDelayMillis`: : Time to wait between consecutive modbus transactions (to the same host or serial device), in milliseconds. Each modbus transaction corresponds to read or write operation. Default 35 for serial slaves and 60 for tcp slaves.
- `reconnectAfterMillis`: Time after which connection is disconnected and re-established, in milliseconds. Default 0 (closes connection after every transaction).
- `interConnectDelayMillis`: Time to wait between consecutive connection attempts (to the same host or ip), in milliseconds. Default 0.
- `connectMaxTries`: Maximum tries when establishing connection. Default 3.
- `connectTimeout`: Maximum time to wait for connection establishment, in milliseconds. Default is zero which corresponds to infinite/OS default.
- `receiveTimeoutMillis`: Maximum time to wait for a single "read operation" (sequence of bytes) before giving up, in milliseconds. Default 1500. 
- `flowControlIn`: Flow control for the input data. Default `none`. Valid values: `none`, `xon/xoff in`, `rts/cts in`.
- `flowControlOut`: Flow control for the output data. Default `none`. Valid values: `none`, `xon/xoff out`, `rts/cts out`.

Most important of these is the `interTransactionDelayMillis` which ensures that Modbus RTU (serial) has enough "silent time" between the transactions, as required by the Modbus/RTU protocol. Furthermore it ensures that modbus slave (applies to both tcp and serial slaves) is not spammed with too many transactions, for example some PLC devices might not be able to handle many requests coming in a short time window.

These new parameters have conservative defaults, meaning that they should work for most users. In some cases when extreme performance is required (e.g. poll period below 10ms), one might want to decrease the delay parameters, especially `interTransactionDelayMillis`. With some slower devices on might need to increase the values.

With low baud rates and/or long read requests (that is, large `length` parameter is modbus slave definition), [there might be need to increase `receiveTimeoutMillis` to something larger](https://community.openhab.org/t/connection-pooling-in-modbus-binding/5246/205), e.g. `5000`.

Examples:

- `serial.serialslave1.connection=/dev/ttyS0:38400:8:none:1:rtu:150` connect to serial slave using with `interTransactionDelayMillis` of 150ms
- `tcp.tcpslave1.connection=192.168.1.100:502:0` connect to tcp slave with no `interTransactionDelayMillis`

## Item Configuration

ModbusBindingProvider provides binding for openHAB Items.

There are three ways to bind an item to modbus coils/registers. 

### Single coil/register per item

```ini
Switch MySwitch "My Modbus Switch" (ALL) {modbus="slave1:5"}
```
- This binds MySwitch to modbus slave defined as "slave1" in `modbus.cfg` reading/writing to the coil (5 + slave's `start` index). The `5` is called item read index.
- If the slave is read-only, that is the `type` is `input` or `discrete`, the binding ignores any write commands. 
- if the slave1 refers to registers, and after parsing using the registers as rules defined by the `valuetype`, zero value is considered as `OFF`, everything else as `ON`.

### Separate coils for reading and writing

```ini
Switch MySwitch "My Modbus Switch" (ALL) {modbus="slave1:<6:>7"}
``` 

- In this case coil 6 is used as status coil (read-only) and commands are put to coil 7 by setting coil 7 to true.
- (?) Your hardware should then set coil 7 back to false to allow further commands processing (Note 16.3.2016: does this relate to [issue #3685](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/issues/3685)?).

### input coil only for reading

```ini
Contact Contact1 "Contact1 [MAP(en.map):%s]" (All)   {modbus="slave2:0"}
```

- In this case regarding to moxa example coil 0 is used as discrete input (in Moxa naming DI-00)
- (?) following examples are relatively useless, if you know better one let us know!
counter values in most cases 16bit values, now we must do math: in rules to deal with them ...

### Read / write register (number) 

```ini
Number Dimmer1 "Dimmer1 [%d]" (ALL) {modbus="slave4:0"}
```

and in sitemap you can for example

```ini
Setpoint item=Dimmer1 minValue=0 maxValue=100 step=5
```
**NOTE:** if the item value goes over the max value specified by the `valuetype` (e.g. 32767 with `int16`), the effects are fully untested!!!

(?) this example should write the value to all DO bits of an moxa e1212 as byte value

5. read only register `type=input`

```ini
Number MyCounterH "My Counter high [%d]" (All) {modbus="slave3:0"}
```

this reads counter 1 high word when valuetype=`int8` or `uint8`

```ini
Number MyCounterL "My Counter low [%d]" (All) {modbus="slave3:1"}
```

this reads counter 1 low word when valuetype=`int8` or `uint8`

6. floating point value numbers

When using a float32 value you must use [%f] in item description.

```ini
Number MyCounter "My Counter [%f]" (All) {modbus="slave5:0"}`
```


# Details


## Modbus functions supported

### Supported Modbus object types
Modbus binding allows to connect to multiple Modbus slaves. The binding supports following Modbus *object types*

- coils, also known as *digital out (DO)* (read & write)
- discrete inputs, also known as *digital in (DI)* (read)
- input registers (read)
- holding registers (read & write)

Binding can be configured to interpret values stored in the 16bit registers in different ways, e.g. as signed or unsigned integer.

For more information on these object types, please consult [Modbus wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus).

### Read and write functions

Modbus specification has different operations for reading and writing different object types. These types of operations are identified by *function code*. Some devices support only certain function codes.

For more background information, please consult [Modbus wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus).

The binding uses following function codes when communicating with the slaves:

- read coils: function code (FC) 1 (*Read Coils*)
- write coil: FC 5  (*Write Single Coil*)
- read discrete inputs: FC 2 (*Read Discrete Inputs*)
- read input registers: FC 4 (*Read Input Registers*)
- read holding registers: FC 3 (*Read Multiple Holding Registers*)
- write holding register: FC 6 (*Write Single Holding Register*), OR  FC 16 (*Write Multiple Holding Registers*) (see note on `writemultipleregisters` configuration parameter below)



## Comment on addressing
[Modbus Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus#Coil.2C_discrete_input.2C_input_register.2C_holding_register_numbers_and_addresses) summarizes this excellently:

> In the traditional standard, [entity] numbers for those entities start with a digit, followed by a number of four digits in range 1–9,999:

> - coils numbers start with a zero and then span from 00001 to 09999
> - discrete input numbers start with a one and then span from 10001 to 19999
> - input register numbers start with a three and then span from 30001 to 39999
> - holding register numbers start with a four and then span from 40001 to 49999

> This translates into [entity] addresses between 0 and 9,998 in data frames.

The openhab modbus binding uses data frame entity addresses when referring to modbus entities. That is, the entity address configured in modbus binding is passed to modbus protocol frame as-is. For example, modbus slave definition with `start=3`, `length=2` and `type=holding` will read modbus entities with the following numbers 40004 and 40005.

## Many modbus binding slaves for single physical slave

One needs to configure as many modbus slaves to openhab as there are corresponding modbus requests. For example, in order to poll status of `coil` and `holding` items from a single [physical] modbus slave, two separate modbus slave definitions need to be configured in the `modbus.cfg`. For example:

```ini
serial.slave1.connection=/dev/pts/8:38400:8:none:1:rtu
serial.slave1.type=coil
serial.slave1.length=3

serial.slave2.connection=/dev/pts/8:38400:8:none:1:rtu
serial.slave2.type=holding
serial.slave2.length=5
```

Please note that the binding requires that all slaves connecting to the same serial port share the same connection parameters (e.g. baud-rate, parity, ..). In particular are different parameter settings considered bad practice, because they can confuse the instances (slaves) on the modbus.  For additional information, see [this discussion](https://community.openhab.org/t/connection-pooling-in-modbus-binding/5246/161?u=ssalonen) in the community forums.

Similarly, one must have identical connection parameters for all tcp slaves connecting to same host+port.

## Read and write functions (modbus slave type)
Modbus read functions 
- `type=coil` uses function 1 "Read Coil Status" 
- `type=discrete` uses function 2 "Read Input Status" (readonly inputs)
- `type=holding` uses function 3, "Read Holding Registers"
- `type=input` uses function 4 "Read Input Register" (readonly-registers eG analogue inputs)

Modbus write functions 
- `type=coil` uses function 5 "Write Single Coil"
- `type=holding` uses function 6 "Write Single Register", or function 16 "Write Multiple registers" when `writemultipleregisters` is `true`

See also [simplymodbus.ca](http://www.simplymodbus.ca) and [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus#Supported_function_codes).


## Register interpretation (valuetype) on read & write

Note that this section applies to register elements only (`holding` or `input` type)

### Read

When the binding interprets and converts polled input registers (`input`) or holding registers (`holding`) to openhab items, the process goes like this:

- 1. register(s) are first parsed to a number (see below for the details, exact logic depends on `valuetype`)
- 2a. if the item is Switch or Contact: zero is converted CLOSED / OFF. Other numbers are converted to OPEN / ON.
- 2b. if the item is Number: the value is passed as is

The logic for converting read registers to number goes as below. Different procedure is taken depending on `valuetype`. 

Note that <i>first register</i> refers to register with address `start` (as defined in the slave definition), <i>second register</i> refers to register with address `start + 1` etc. The <i>index</i> refers to item read index, e.g. item `Switch MySwitch "My Modbus Switch" (ALL) {modbus="slave1:5"}` has 5 as read index.

`valuetype=bit`:
- a single bit is read from the registers
- indices between 0...15 (inclusive) represent bits of the first register
- indices between 16...31 (inclusive) represent bits of the second register, etc.
- index 0 refers to the least significant bit of the first register
- index 1 refers to the second least significant bit of the first register, etc.
(Note that updating a bit in a holding type register will NOT work as expected across Modbus, the whole register gets rewritten. Best to use a read-only mode, such as Contact item.  Input type registers are by definition read-only.)

`valuetype=int8`:
- a byte (8 bits) from the registers is interpreted as signed integer
- index 0 refers to low byte of the first register, 1 high byte of first register
- index 2 refers to low byte of the second register, 3 high byte of second register, etc.
- it is assumed that each high and low byte is encoded in most significant bit first order

`valuetype=uint8`:
- same as `int8` except values are interpreted as unsigned integers

`valuetype=int16`:
- register with index (counting from zero) is interpreted as 16 bit signed integer.
- it is assumed that each register is encoded in most significant bit first order

`valuetype=uint16`:
- same as `int16` except values are interpreted as unsigned integers

`valuetype=int32`:
- registers (2 index) and ( 2 *index + 1) are interpreted as signed 32bit integer.
- it assumed that the first register contains the most significant 16 bits
- it is assumed that each register is encoded in most significant bit first order

`valuetype=uint32`:
- same as `int32` except values are interpreted as unsigned integers

`valuetype=float32`:
- registers (2 index) and ( 2 *index + 1) are interpreted as signed 32bit floating point number.
- it assumed that the first register contains the most significant 16 bits
- it is assumed that each register is encoded in most significant bit first order

#### Word Swapped valuetypes (New since 1.9.0)
The MODBUS specification defines each 16bit word to be encoded as Big Endian,
but there is no specification on the order of those words within 32bit or larger data types.
The net result is that when you have a master and slave that operate with the same
Endian mode things work fine, but add a device with a different Endian mode and it is
very hard to correct. To resolve this the binding supports a second set of valuetypes
that have the words swapped.

If you get strange values using the int32, uint32 or float32 valuetypes then just try the int32_swap, uint32_swap or float32_swap valuetype, depending upon what your data type is.

`valuetype=int32_swap`:
- registers (2 index) and ( 2 *index + 1) are interpreted as signed 32bit integer.
- it assumed that the first register contains the least significant 16 bits
- it is assumed that each register is encoded in most significant bit first order (Big Endian)

`valuetype=uint32_swap`:
- same as `int32_swap` except values are interpreted as unsigned integers

`valuetype=float32_swap`:
- registers (2 index) and ( 2 *index + 1) are interpreted as signed 32bit floating point number.
- it assumed that the first register contains the least significant 16 bits
- it is assumed that each register is encoded in most significant bit first order (Big Endian)


#### Extra notes
- `valuetypes` smaller than one register (less than 16 bits) actually read the whole register, and finally extract single bit from the result.

### Write

When the binding processes openhab command (e.g. sent by `sendCommand` as explained [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Actions)), the process goes as follows

1. it is checked whether the associated item is bound to holding register. If not, command is ignored.
2. command is converted to 16bit integer (in [two's complement format](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html)) (see below for details)
3. the 16bits are written to the register with address `start` (as defined in the slave definition)

Conversion rules for converting command to 16bit integer
- UP, ON, OPEN commands that are converter to number 1
- DOWN, OFF, CLOSED commands are converted to number 0 
- Decimal commands are truncated as 32 bit integer (in 2's complement representation), and then the least significant 16 bits of this integer are extracted.

**Note: The way Decimal commands are handled currently means that it is probably not useful to try to use Decimal commands with non-16bit `valuetype`s.**

Converting INCREASE and DECREASE commands to numbers is more complicated
1. Register matching (`start` + read index) is interpreted as unsigned 16bit integer. Previous polled register value is used
2. add/subtract `1` from the integer

**Note: note that INCREASE and DECREASE ignore valuetype when using the previously polled value. Thus, it is not recommended to use INCREASE and DECREASE commands with other than `valuetype=uint16`**

### Modbus RTU over TCP 
Some devices uses modbus RTU over TCP. This is usually Modbus RTU encapsulation in an ethernet packet. So, those devices does not work with Modbus TCP binding since it is Modbus with a special header. Also Modbus RTU over TCP is not supported by Openhab Modbus Binding. But there is a workaround: you can use a Virtual Serial Port Server, to emulate a COM Port and Bind it with OpenHab unsing Modbus Serial.



### Config Examples

Please take a look at [Samples-Binding-Config page](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Samples-Binding-Config) or examine to the following examples.

- Minimal construction in modbus.cfg for TCP connections will look like:

```ini
# read 10 coils starting from address 0
tcp.slave1.connection=192.168.1.50
tcp.slave1.length=10
tcp.slave1.type=coil
```
 
- Minimal construction in modbus.cfg for serial connections will look like:

```ini
# read 10 coils starting from address 0
serial.slave1.connection=/dev/ttyUSB0
tcp.slave1.length=10
tcp.slave1.type=coil
```

- More complex setup could look like

```ini
# Poll values very 300ms = 0.3 seconds
poll=300

# Connect to modbus slave at 192.168.1.50, port 502
tcp.slave1.connection=192.168.1.50:502
# use slave id 41 in requests
tcp.slave1.id=41
# read 32 coils (digital outputs) starting from address 0
tcp.slave1.start=0
tcp.slave1.length=32
tcp.slave1.type=coil
```

- Another example where coils, discrete inputs (`discrete`) and input registers (`input`) are polled from modbus tcp slave at `192.168.6.180`.

> (original example description:)
> example for an moxa e1214 module in simple io mode
> 6 output switches starting from modbus address 0 and
> 6 inputs from modbus address 10000 (the function 2 implizits the modbus 10000 address range)
> you only read 6 input bits and say start from 0
> the moxa manual ist not right clear in this case 

```ini
poll=300

# Query coils from 192.168.6.180
tcp.slave1.connection=192.168.6.180:502
tcp.slave1.id=1
tcp.slave1.start=0
tcp.slave1.length=6
tcp.slave1.type=coil

# Query discrete inputs from 192.168.6.180
tcp.slave2.connection=192.168.6.180:502
tcp.slave2.id=1
tcp.slave2.start=0
tcp.slave2.length=6
tcp.slave2.type=discrete

# Query input registers from 192.168.6.180
tcp.slave3.connection=192.168.6.180:502
tcp.slave3.id=1
tcp.slave3.start=17
tcp.slave3.length=2
tcp.slave3.type=input

# Query holding registers from 192.168.6.181
# Holding registers matching addresses 33 and 34 are read
tcp.slave4.connection=192.168.6.181:502
tcp.slave4.id=1
tcp.slave4.start=33
tcp.slave4.length=2
tcp.slave4.type=holding

# Query 2 input registers from 192.168.6.181. 
# Interpret the two registers as single 32bit floating point number
tcp.slave5.connection=192.168.6.181:502
tcp.slave5.id=1
tcp.slave5.start=10
tcp.slave5.length=2
tcp.slave5.type=input
tcp.slave5.valuetype=float32
```

Above we used the same modbus gateway with ip 192.168.6.180 multiple times 
on different modbus address ranges and modbus functions.


# Troubleshooting

## Enable verbose logging 

Enable `DEBUG` or `TRACE` (even more verbose) logging for the loggers named:

* `net.wimpi.modbus`
* `org.openhab.binding.modbus`

# For developers

## Testing serial implementation

You can use test serial slaves without any hardware on linux using these steps:

1. Set-up virtual null modem emulator using [tty0tty](https://github.com/freemed/tty0tty)
2. Download [diagslave](http://www.modbusdriver.com/diagslave.html) and start modbus serial slave up using this command: 
```
./diagslave -m rtu -a 1 -b 38400 -d 8 -s 1 -p none -4 10 /dev/pts/7
```
3. Configure openhab's modbus slave to connect to `/dev/pts/8`: 
```ini
xxx.connection=/dev/pts/8:38400:8:none:1:rtu
```
4. Modify `start.sh` or `start_debug.sh` to include the unconventional port name by adding the following argument to `java`: 
```
-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/pts/8
```

Naturally this is not the same thing as the real thing but helps to identify simple issues.

## Testing TCP implementation

1. Download [diagslave](http://www.modbusdriver.com/diagslave.html) and start modbus tcp server (slave) using this command: 
```
./diagslave -m tcp -a 1 -p 55502
```
2. Configure openhab's modbus slave to connect to `127.0.0.1:55502`: 
```ini
tcp.slave1.connection=127.0.0.1:55502
```

## Writing data

See this [community post](https://community.openhab.org/t/something-is-rounding-my-float-values-in-sitemap/13704/32?u=ssalonen) explaining how `pollmb` and `diagslave` can be used to debug modbus communication.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot, you might be asked to update to latest development version. You can find the "snapshot" or development version from [Cloudbees CI](https://openhab.ci.cloudbees.com/job/openHAB1-Addons/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/bundles/binding/org.openhab.binding.modbus/target/).

With modbus binding before 1.9.0, it strongly recommended to try out with the latest development version since many bugs were fixed in 1.9.0. Furthermore, error logging is enhanced in this new version.

If the problem persists in the new version, it is recommended to try to isolate to issue using minimal configuration. Easiest would be to have a fresh openhab installation, and configure it minimally (if possible, single modbus slave in `modbus.cfg`, single item, no rules etc.). This helps the developers and community to debug the issue.

Problems can be communicated via [community.openhab.org](https://community.openhab.org). Please use the search function to find out existing reports of the same issue. 

It helps greatly to document the issue in detail (especially how to reproduce the issue), and attach the related [verbose logs](#enable-verbose-debug-logging). Try to keep interaction minimal during this test; for example, if the problem occurs with modbus read alone, do not touch the the switch items in openhab sitemap (would trigger write). 

For attaching the logs to a community post, [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) service is strongly recommended to keep the thread readable. It is useful to store the logs from openhab startup, and let it run for a while.

Remember to attach configuration lines from modbus.cfg, item definitions related to modbus binding, and any relevant rules (if any). You can use [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) for this purpose as well.

To summarize, here are the recommended steps in case of errors

1. Update to latest development version; especially if you are using modbus binding version before 1.9.0
2. isolate the issue using minimal configuration, and enable verbose logging (see above)
3. record logs and configuration to [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/)The page contains examples for use with the [[Modbus binding|Modbus-Binding]].

## Rollershutter Items

Since Modbus is a low-level protocol, more abstract concepts like controlling roller shutters can be implemented in a number of different ways.  This example (offered by @ssalonen [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/pull/4654#issuecomment-248996109)) is one approach using openHAB rules and the standard Modbus binding.  Adapt it to your needs, and please edit this wiki page to correct and clarify this example.

### default.rules

```
import org.openhab.core.library.types.DecimalType
import org.openhab.core.library.types.PercentType
// comment out the above imports if running on openHAB 2+

rule "Process roller shutter commands"
when
    Item myRS received command
then
    logInfo("rollerShutterRules", "Processing RS command")
    if(receivedCommand != null){        
        switch(receivedCommand.toString.upperCase) {        
            case "UP" : {
                sendCommand(myRSUpDown, 1)
            }
            case "DOWN":{
                sendCommand(myRSUpDown, -1)
            }
            case "STOP":{ 
                sendCommand(myRSMoveStop, 1)
            }   
            case "MOVE":{
                sendCommand(myRSMoveStop, 0)
            }
        }
    }
end

rule "Update roller shutter position"
when
    Item myRSMoveStop received update
then
    logInfo("rollerShutterRules", "Processing position update")
    var currentPosition = myRSMoveStop.state as DecimalType
    postUpdate(myRS, new PercentType(currentPosition.toBigDecimal))
end
```

### default.items

```

// Main roller shutter item. 
// - State will be updated from register index 0. 
// - Up (1) & Down (-1) commands will be written to register index 1
// - Move (0) & Stop (1) commands will be written to register index 2
Rollershutter myRS "RollerShutter" (livingRoom)

// Helper items for writing data to MODBUS
Number myRSUpDown "RollerShutter Up/Down Control (writing to index 1, read from index 0)" (livingRoom) {modbus="slave1:<0:>1"} 
Number myRSMoveStop "RollerShutter Move/Stop Control (writing to index 2, read from index 0)" (livingRoom) {modbus="slave1:<0:>2"} 
```

### default.sitemap

```
sitemap demo label="Main Menu" {
    // https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Rollershutter-Bindings
    Switch item=myRS label="Roller shutter [(%d)]" mappings=[UP="up", STOP="X", DOWN="down"]
    Text item=myRSMoveStop
    Text item=myRSUpDown
}
```

### For local testing

Starting up modbus tcp server (i.e. modbus slave)

```
./diagslave -m tcp -p 55502
```

services/modbus.cfg

```
tcp.slave1.connection=localhost:55502:0:0:0:1
tcp.slave1.type=holding
tcp.slave1.length=20
tcp.slave1.postundefinedonreaderror=true
```
