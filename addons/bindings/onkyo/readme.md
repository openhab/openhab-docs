# Onkyo Binding

This binding integrates the Onkyo AV receivers.

## Introduction

Binding should be compatible with Onkyo AV receivers which support ISCP (Integra Serial Control Protocol) over Ethernet (eISCP).

## Supported Things

This binding supports only one thing: The Onkyo AV Receiver.  All supported Onkyo devices are registered as an audio sink in the framework.


## Discovery

This binding can discover the supported Onkyo AV Receivers. At the moment only the following models are supported:

* TX-NR414
* TX-NR509
* TX-NR515
* TX-NR525
* TX-NR535
* TX-NR555
* TX-NR535
* TX-NR616
* TX-NR626
* TX-NR636
* TX-NR646
* TX-NR656
* TX-NR717
* TX-NR727
* TX-NR747
* TX-NR818
* TX-NR828
* TX-NR838

## Binding Configuration

The binding can auto-discover the Onkyo AVRs present on your local network. The auto-discovery is enabled by default. To disable it, you can create a file in the services directory called onkyo.cfg with the following content:

```
org.openhab.onkyo:enableAutoDiscovery=false
```

This configuration parameter only controls the Onkyo AVR auto-discovery process, not the openHAB auto-discovery. Moreover, if the openHAB auto-discovery is disabled, the Onkyo AVR auto-discovery is disabled too.


The binding has the following configuration options, which can be set for "binding:onkyo":

| Parameter | Name    | Description  | Required |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|------------ |
| callbackUrl | Callback URL | URL to use for playing notification sounds, e.g. http://192.168.0.2:8080 | no |

## Thing Configuration

The Onkyo AVR thing requires the ip address and the port to access it on.
In the thing file, this looks e.g. like

Model specific

```
onkyo:TX-NR818:myOnkyo [ipAddress="192.168.1.100", port="60128"]
```

or

Generic model

```
onkyo:onkyoAVR:myOnkyo [ipAddress="192.168.1.100", port="60128"]
```

Optionally you can specify the refresh interval by refreshInterval parameter.

```
onkyo:onkyoAVR:myOnkyo [ipAddress="192.168.1.100", port="60128", refreshInterval=30]
```

Maximum volume level can also be configured by volumeLimit parameter. This prevent setting receiver volume level too high, which could damage your speakers or receiver.

```
onkyo:onkyoAVR:myOnkyo [ipAddress="192.168.1.100", port="60128", volumeLimit=50]
```

Binding then automatically scale the volume level in both directions (100% = 50 = 100%).

## Channels

The Onkyo AVR supports the following channels (some channels are model specific):
