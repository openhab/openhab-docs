# Toon Binding
The Toon bindings shows among others current room temperature, setpoint, energy and gas usage information.
It can control the setpoint and current program. Connected smart plugs can also be controlled.


## Supported Things

### Toon Webaccount

Before the binding can be used, a Toon Webaccount must be added. This needs to be done manually. Select `Toon Webaccount`, and enter your username and password.
Afterwards start discovery so your display and connected plugs are discovered. 

### Toon display unit

The display unit holds all channels that represent current room temperature, setpoint, setpoint mode, gas and energy meter readings.

### Toon plug

A Toon plug represents a connected wall plug that can be controlled via Toon.

## Discovery

Once the binding is authorized, and the `Toon Webaccount` is added, you can start the discovery. This will find your Toon Display and put it in the Inbox.

Currently only the display and plugs are discovered. So no Alarms or Hue lights will be discovered.
