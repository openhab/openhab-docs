# Pulseaudio Binding

This binding integrates pulseaudio devices.

## Supported Things
The Pulseaudio bridge is required as a "bridge" for accessing any other Pulseaudio devices.

You need a running pulseaudio server whith module module-cli-protocol-tcp loaded and accessible by the server 
which runs your openHAB instance. The following pulseaudio devices are supported:
 * Sink
 * Source
 * Sink-Input
 * Source-Output
 * Combined-Sink


## Discovery

The Pulseaudio bridge is discovered through mDNS in the local network.


## Thing Configuration

The Pulseaudio bridge requires the ip address (or a hostname) and a port (default: 4712) as a configuration value in order for the binding to know where to access it.


## Channels

All devices support some of the following channels:

| Channel Type ID | Item Type    | Description  |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------- |------------- |
| volume | Dimmer  | Volume of an audio device in percent |
| mute | Switch | Mutes the device |
| state | String | Current state of the device (suspended, idle, running, corked, drained) |
| slaves | String | Slave sinks of a combined sink |
| routeToSink | String | Shows the sink a sink-input is currently routed to |
