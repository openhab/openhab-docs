<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Items** manage the functional layer of openHAB.
Items can be linked to the channels of a Thing to control and read data from a device or service.
Items have a state are used through events.
Items can also be used to store information that is just used by your openHAB system itself.

There is an [Items concepts page]({{base}}/concepts/items.html) that explains the idea of Items in detail.

On these pages you can manage all the Items you have added to your system:

- **Add new Items**<br>
  Add individual Items using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button and, if needed, manually link them to a channel.
- **Configure Items**<br>
  Click on any Item in the list to see its configuration page.
- **Delete Items**<br>
  Select multiple Items using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Item</span> button on the individual Item pages.
