# Settings - Items

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Items** are openHAB's information storage and control structures.
Items can be linked to the channels of a Thing to control and read data from a device or service.
Items can also be used to store information that is just used by your openHAB system itself.

On these pages you can manage all the Items you have added to your system:

- **Add new Items**<br>
  Add individual Items using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button and, if needed, manually link them to a channel.
- **Configure Items**<br>
  Click on any Item in the list to see its configuration page.
- **Delete Items**<br>
  Select multiple Items using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Item</span> button on the individual Item pages.
