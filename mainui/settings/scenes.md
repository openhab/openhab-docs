# Settings - Scenes

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Rules** are the heart of home automation.
**Scenes** are special types of rules, which require no coding.
Scenes allow you to define an Item and its respective state very easily and combine multiple of them as a collection of item actions to be run.
Note that the Scenes do not support triggers or conditions and need to be explicitly triggered via a page or a rule.

A comprehensive introduction to scenes can be found at the [scenes tutorial]({{base}}/tutorial/rules_scenes.html).

On this page you can manage all the scenes you have added to your system:

- **Add new Scenes**<br>
  Add Scenes using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button.
- **Edit Scenes**<br>
  Click on any scene in the list to edit the scene's Item commands.
- **Delete Scenes**<br>
  Select multiple scenes using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Scene</span> button on the individual scene pages.
- **Enable/Disable Scenes**<br>
  Use the <!--F7 pause_circle --> pause buttons on the individual scene pages.
- **Manually run Scenes**<br>
  Use the <!--F7:blue play --> play button on the individual scene pages to have the scene run immediately.
