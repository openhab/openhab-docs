# Settings - Scripts

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Rules** are the heart of home automation.
**Scripts** are special types of rules with only one action.
They can be used to reuse code and logic across multiple other rules, one off experimentation to figure something out, create a catalog of examples, or to drive tests for other rules and behaviors.

On this page you can manage all the scripts you have added to your system:

- **Add new Scripts**<br>
  Add scripts using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button.
- **Edit Scripts**<br>
  Click on any script in the list to edit the action of the script.
- **Delete Scripts**<br>
  Select multiple scripts using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Script</span> button on the individual scripts' pages.
- **Enable/Disable Scripts**<br>
  Select multiple scripts using the top **Select** button and use the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons at the bottom or use <!--F7 pause_circle --> pause button on the individual scripts' pages.
- **Manually run Scripts**<br>
