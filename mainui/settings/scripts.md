# Settings - Scripts

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Rules** are the heart of home automation.
**Scripts** are special types of rules with only one action and no triggers, so they have to be called from "real" rules or run manually.
They can be used to reuse code and logic across multiple other rules, for experimentation to figure something out, create a catalog of examples, or to drive tests for other rules and behaviors.

On this page you can manage all the scripts you have added to your system:

- **Add new Scripts**<br>
  Add scripts using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button.
- **Edit Scripts**<br>
  Click on any script in the list to edit the action of the script.
- **Delete Scripts**<br>
  Select multiple scripts using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Script</span> button on the individual scripts' pages.
- **Enable/Disable Scripts**<br>
  Select multiple scripts using the top **Select** button and use the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons at the bottom or use <!--F7 pause_circle --> pause button on the individual scripts' pages.
- **Manually run Scripts**<br>
  Use the <!--F7:blue play --> play button on the individual script pages to have the rule run all actions immediately.
