# Settings - Rules

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Rules** are the heart of home automation - automate with triggers, actions and conditions.
Rules can be as simple as a directive to turn on a single light at a given time but the use of scripting languages and Blockly also allows much more complex automations.

Community made Rule Templates can also be added to your system from the **Automation** tab of the add-on store.

There is a [rules concepts page]({{base}}/concepts/rules.html) that explains the idea of rules in detail, and a comprehensive introduction to rules in the [rules tutorial]({{base}}/tutorial/rules_basic.html).

On this page you can manage all the basic rules you have added to your system:

![rules-overview](../images/rules-overview.png)

- **Add new Rules**<br>
  Add rules using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button.
- **Configure Rules**<br>
  Click on any rule in the list to configure the rule or write a script action for the rule.
- **Delete Rules**<br>
  Select multiple rules using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Rule</span> button on the individual rule pages.
- **Enable/Disable Rules**<br>
  Select multiple rules using the top **Select** button and use the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons at the bottom or use <!--F7 pause_circle --> pause button on the individual rule pages.
- **Manually run Rules**<br>
  Use the <!--F7:blue play --> play button on the individual rule pages to have the rule run all actions immediately.

The page has a searchable list of rules with the following attributes:

- name
- unique id
- description
- enabled state (disabled, enabled, idle, running)
- tags

The searchbar allows to filter by the name, the description and the tags of that rule.

When clicking "select" in the top right corner, the list allows to select multiple entries at the same time:

![rules-selection](../images/rules-selection.png)

After selecting one or multiple rules three options appear in the footer to allow

- removing
- disabling or
- enabling

these rules.
Press "Done" to return back to the normal list view.

To add a rule press the plus icon ![add rule](../images/plus.png) in the lower right corner and follow the [rules tutorial]({{base}}/tutorial/rules_basic.html#create-the-rule).
