# Settings - Rules

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Rules** are the heart of home automation.
They allow openHAB to respond to different events with automatic reactions.
Rules can be a simple as a directive to turn on a single light at a given time but full scripting languages also allow for more complex reactions.

Community made Rule Templates can also be added to your system from the **Automation** tab of the add-on store.

On this page you can manage all the basic rules you have added to your system:

- **Add new Rules**<br>
  Add rules using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button.
- **Configure Rules**<br>
  Click on any rule in the list to configure the rule or write a script action for the rule.
- **Delete Rules**<br>
  Select multiple rules using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** button at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Remove Rule</span> button on the individual rule pages.
- **Enable/Disable Rules**<br>
  Select multiple rules using the top **Select** button and use the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons at the bottom or use <!--F7 pause_circle --> pause button on the individual rule pages.
- **Manually run Rules**<br>
  Use the <!--F7:blue play --> play button on the individual rule pages to have the rule run all actions immediately.
