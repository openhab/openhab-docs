# Settings - Things

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
**Things** are the openHAB structures that represent individual devices or services.
The Things that you can add to your system are determined by the bindings that you have installed.

On this page, you can manage all the Things you have added to your system:

- **Add new Things**<br>
  Use the [Thing Inbox](#inbox) to scan for available things or manually add ones that cannot be found automatically using the <!--F7:blue plus_circle_fill --> plus button.
- **Configure Things**<br>
  Click on any Thing in the list to see its configuration page and it's channels.
- **Delete Things**<br>
  Select multiple Things using the top **Select** button and use the **Remove** buttons at the bottom or use the <span style="color: red">Delete Thing</span> button on the individual Thing pages.
- **Enable/Disable Things**<br>
  Select multiple Things using the top **Select** button and use the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons at the bottom or use the <!--F7 pause_circle --> pause button on the individual Thing pages.
