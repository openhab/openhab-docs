# Settings - Overview

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
The settings menu provides access to all openHAB setup and server-related settings that are configurable from the UI.
Please note that this page is only accessible for users with the administrator role.

The settings menu includes:

- [**Things**](things.html)<br>
  Configure and add your IoT devices and services.
- [**Model**](model.html)<br>
  Configure the semantically enhanced representation of the user facing aspects of your system.
- [**Items**](items.html)<br>
  Basic units of openHAB control and information fully hardware-independent.
- [**Pages**](pages.html)<br>
  Manage custom user interfaces including Main UI pages and sitemaps.
- [**Transformations**](transformations.html)<br>
  Transformations convert a value or Item state into different value or state.
- [**Persistence**](persistence.html)<br>
  openHAB can store data over time; this is known as persistence.
  The data may be retrieved at a later time, for example to restore your system after startup, or to prepare graphs for display on a UI.
- [**Rules**](rules.html)<br>
  Rules are essential for home automation:
  Each rule can be triggered, which invokes a script that performs any kinds of tasks, e.g. turn on lights by modifying your items, do mathematical calculations, start timers etc.
- [**Scenes**](scenes.html)<br>
  Special rules determined to command a some Items to a pre-defined state.
- [**Scripts**](scrips.html)<br>
  Special rules without triggers and with just one action determined to run code.
- [**Schedule**](schedule.html)<br>
  Provides an overview of rules with time-based triggers and the `Schedule` tag.
