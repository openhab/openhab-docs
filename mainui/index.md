# Main UI - Overview

<!-- START MAINUI SIDEBAR DOC - DO NOT REMOVE -->
Since openHAB 3.0, the so-called "Main UI" is the primary web user interface of openHAB.
It allows you to configure openHAB system, and provides a user interface for monitoring and control of your smart home.

If you are new to openHAB, please refer to the [Getting Started guide]({{base}}/tutorial/), which is introducing you to Main UI by using it to set up openHAB.

Users with the administrator role can use the left panel menu to access:

- [**Settings**](settings)<br>
  The settings menu provides access to all settings that are configurable from the UI.
- [**Add-on Store**](addons)<br>
  openHAB can and has to be extended via add-ons. Add-ons include bindings, automation, persistence and much more. Visit the store to discover all available add-ons.
- [**Developer Tools**](developer)<br>
  Special functions including creation of custom widgets and block libraries as well as the developer sidebar.
- [**Help & About**](about)<br>
  The about page shows general information of your openHAB configuration and allows to configure some client related configuration.
