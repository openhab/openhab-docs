# TinkerForge Actions

The TinkerForge Action service provides direct interaction with some of the TinkerForge devices. 

## Prerequisites

The action service depends on the TinkerForge Binding (1.x) being installed and configured. Add at least a hosts configuration value in the binding's configuration.

## Actions

These action functions are available:

* `tfClearLCD(String uid)`

	Clears the display of the LCD with the given uid.

  Example:

  ```
  rule "clear lcd"
      when
          Item ClearLCD received command ON
      then
         tfClearLCD("d4j")
  end
  ```

* `tfServoSetposition(String uid, String num, String position, String velocity, String acceleration)`

  Sets the position of a TinkerForge servo with the uid $uid and servo number to the position $position using the speed $speed and acceleration $acceleration.

  Example:

	```
	rule "move servo"
    when
        Item MoveServo received command ON
    then
       tfServoSetposition("6Crt5W", "servo0", "0", "65535", "65535")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfServoSetposition("6Crt5W", "servo0", "-9000", "65535", "65535")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
      tfServoSetposition("6Crt5W", "servo0", "9000", "65535", "65535")
  end
	```

* `tfDCMotorSetspeed(String uid, String speed, String acceleration, String drivemode)`

  Sets the speed of a TinkerForge DC motor with the given uid to $speed using the acceleration $acceleration and the drivemode $drivemode.

	* speed: value between -32767 - 32767
	* drivemode is either "break" or "coast"

	Example:

	```
	rule "move motor"
    when
        Item DCMOVE received command ON
    then
       var String acceleration = "10000"
       var String speed = "15000"
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
  end
	```

* `tfDCMotorSetspeed(String uid, Short speed, Integer acceleration, String drivemode)`

  Sets the speed of a TinkerForge DC motor with the given uid to $speed using the acceleration $acceleration and the drivemode $drivemode.

  * speed: value between -32767 - 32767
  * drivemode is either "break" or "coast"

  Example:

	```
	rule "move motor"
    when
        Item DCMOVE received command ON
    then
       var Integer acceleration = 10000
       var Short speed = 15000
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
       Thread::sleep(1000)
       tfDCMotorSetspeed("62Zduj", speed, acceleration, "break")
	end
  ```

* `tfRotaryEncoderClear(String uid)`

	Clears the rotary encoder counter with the given uid.

  Example:

  ```
    rule "Clear"
        when Item Clear changed
    then 
	   tfRotaryEncoderClear("kHv")
    end
  ```

* `tfLoadCellTare(String uid)`
 	Sets tare on the load cell bricklet with the given uid.

  Example:

  ```
    rule "Tare"
        when 
                Item Tare changed to ON
        then
                postUpdate(TareValue, Weight.state)
                tfLoadCellTare("v8V")
    end
  ```
