## Community Guidelines

We want to keep the openHAB community awesome, growing and collaborative.
We need your help to keep it that way.
To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

* **Be nice:** Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no
  regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people
  way better than mean ones!

* **Encourage diversity and participation:** Make everyone in our community
  feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their
  contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in
  our community.

* **Keep it legal:** Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that
  you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the
  law.

* **Stay on topic:** Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel
  and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or
  respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of
  people.  Please consider this before you update.  Also remember that
  nobody likes spam.
