# AllPlay Binding

This binding integrates devices compatible with [Qualcomm AllPlay](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/allplay).
The binding uses native libraries for the AllJoyn framework. Libraries for the following platforms are already included in the binding:

* Linux ARM
* Linux x86 (32 bit)
* Linux x86-64 (64 bit)
* Windows x86 (32 bit)
* Windows x86-64 (64 bit)

If there is need for another architecture/platform, please open a [ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/issues) so the missing native library can be added.

## Supported Things

All AllPlay compatible speakers are supported by this binding. This includes for example the [Panasonic ALL series](http://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/home-entertainment/wireless-speaker-systems.html).

## Discovery

The AllPlay devices are discovered through the AllJoyn discovery mechanism and are put in the Inbox upon discovery.
