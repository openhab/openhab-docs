# RFXCOM Binding

The binding should be compatible at least with RFXtrx433 USB 433.92MHz transceiver, which contains both receiver and transmitter functions. The RFXtrx433E is fully compatible with the RFXtrx433, and has in addition the possibility to transmit RFY (Somfy RTS) RF command at the frequency used by Somfy.

The RFXCOM binding currently supports the following packet types:

* Blinds1
* Control
* Current
* Curtain1
* Energy
* Humidity
* Interface
* Lighting1
* Lighting2
* Lighting4
* Lighting5
* Lighting6
* Factory
* Interface
* Rain
* Rfy
* Security1
* Security2
* TemperatureHumidity
* Temperature
* Thermostat1
* Transmitter
* Wind

There is also a binding specifically for openHAB 2 [here](http://docs.openhab.org/addons/bindings/rfxcom/readme.html).

**Whilst the range of supported devices is impressive, not all of them are compatible with the binding for openHAB yet**

## Binding Configuration

The binding can be configured in the file `services/rfxcom.cfg`.

| Key | Default | Required | Description |
|-----|---------|:--------:|-------------|
| serialPort |  |    Yes   | the serial port on the host system where RFXCOM controller is connected, e.g. `COM1` on Windows,`/dev/ttyS0` on Linux or `/dev/tty.PL2303-0000103D` on Mac.<br/>NOTE: On Linux, should the RFXCOM device be added to the `dialout` group, you may get an error stating the the serial port cannot be opened when the RfxCom plugin tries to load.  You can get around this by adding the `openhab` user to the `dialout` group like this: `usermod -a -G dialout openhab`. Also on Linux you may have issues with the USB if using two serial USB devices e.g. RFXcom and ZWave. See the [wiki page on symlinks](https://github.com/openhab/openhab1-addons/wiki/symlinks). |
| setMode |     |    No    | can be used to configure RFXCOM controller to listen to various receiver protocols. This is very useful because the receiver will become more sensitive when only the required protocols are enabled. Example: `0D000000035300000C2F00000000`. You can use the RFXmngr application [found in the Downloads section of the RFXcom website (Windows only)](http://www.rfxcom.com/) to get the valid configuration command. Command must be a 28 characters (14 bytes) hexadecimal string.  You can also use RFXmngr to get the Device Ids needed to bind each item to openHAB. |

## Item Configuration

The syntax for "in" bindings (updating item states):

```
rfxcom="<<DeviceId>:<ValueSelector>"
```

The syntax for "out" bindings (sending commands to items):

```
rfxcom="><DeviceId>:<PacketType>.<SubType>:<ValueSelector>"
```

### DeviceId must be provided in decimal

RFXmngr and the openHAB logging outputs may display something like this example from a HomeEasy wireless wall switch.

```
Packet Length   = 0B
Packettype      = Lighting2
Subtype         = AC
Id              = 00130FE2
Unitcode        = 11
Command         = Off
Dim level       = 0%
```

You wouldn't be forgiven for thinking the `<DeviceId>` is `00130FE2` but this is not the Id you need.

This is the correct `<DeviceId>` but it is in the wrong (hexadecimal) format. You need to convert it to decimal, using a tool like [binaryhexconverter.com](http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter). You simply put the HEX `00130FE2` in the correct field and press convert.

Use the converted decimal number (easy to identify as it won't contain any letters) as the `<DeviceId>`.

So continuing with the above example. The displayed Id in HEX was `00130FE2` this is converted into DEC `1249250`. Also for this packettype (Lighting2) you need to join the Unitcode `11` to the `<DeviceId>`, so finally the binding for the item is:

```
Switch    Wall_Switch_FF_Office    {rfxcom="<1249250.11:Command"}
```

#### Finding the correct DeviceId for your items

If you want to add cheap 433 MHz devices like PT2622 remotes, contacts, sensors or wireless outlets and don't know the correct values, you can start openHAB in debug mode, press the buttons on the original remote or act on the sensor.

To pair the entry-level wireless remote outlets (Elro, Intertechno, Intertek, Pollin, ...) you can do the following:

* Enable Lighting4 protocol using the RFXMgr or `setMode`
* Run openHAB in debug mode
* Press a button on the original remote controller (here I press `A ON`) and read the DeviceId `Id` and the pulse width `Pulse` from the output:

```text
[DEBUG] [.b.r.internal.RFXComConnection:148  ] - Data received:
- Packet type = LIGHTING4
- Id = 1285
- Command = ON
- Pulse = 318
```

You can use these values to configure the binding to receive and send data.

Alternately, you can enable DEBUG logging for the logger named `org.openhab.binding.rfxcom`.

> Some devices like Oregon Thermo Hygrometer changes the `<DeviceId>` every time you remove the batteries.  When you change your batteries you will have to get the new `<DeviceId>` and update the item.

### PacketType.SubType Examples

| Packet       | `<PacketType>.<SubType>` | Examples  |
| -------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Lighting1    | `SensorId.UnitCode` | `B.1` or `B.2` or `B.0` (note 1) |
| Lighting2    | `SensorId.UnitCode` | `636602.1` or `636602.0`  (note 1) |
| Lighting4    | `SensorId` | `1285` |
| Lighting5    | `SensorId.UnitCode` | `636602.1` |
| Lighting6    | `SensorId.GroupCode.UnitCode` | `257.B.1` or `64343.B.2` or `636602.H.5` |
| Curtain1     | `SensorId.UnitCode` | `P.1` (note 2) |
| TemperatureHumidity, Current, Energy etc | `SensorId.UnitCode` | `2561` |
| Security2    | `S2_SensorId` | `S2_12567` |
| RfyMessage   | `Id1.Id2.Id3.UnitCode` | `0.12.12.1` (note 3) |

Notes:

1. Where "0" would control all items on device,
1. See the RFXcom documents/manual for more information
1. See the RFXcom documents/manual, for defining the Ids and Unit code, you should pair the RFXcom with your somfy motor using RFXMgr program
