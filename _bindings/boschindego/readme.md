# Bosch Indego Binding

This is the Binding for Bosch Indego Connect lawn mowers.

ThankÂ´s to zazaz-de who found out how the API works. His [Java Library](https://github.com/zazaz-de/iot-device-bosch-indego-controller) made this Binding possible. 

## Configuration of the thing


Currently the binding supports  ***indego***  mowers as a thing type with this parameters: 

| parameter  | datatype  | required |
|---|---|---|
| username      | String | yes |
| password      | String | yes |
| refresh       | integer| no (default: 180, minimum: 60)|

The refresh interval is specified in seconds. 

A possible entry in your thing file could be:

```
boschindego:indego:lawnmower [username="myname@myhost.tld", password="idontneedtocutthelawnagain", refresh=120]
```


## Channels

 channel  | item-type  | description |
|---|---|---|
| state      | Number | You can send commands to this channel to control the mower and read the simplified state from it (1=mow, 2=return to dock, 3=pause)|
| errorcode      | Number | Errorcode of the mower (0=no error, readonly) |
| statecode       | Number | Detailed state of the mower. I included English and German map-files to read the state easier (readonly)|
|textualstate| String| State as a text. (readonly)|
|ready | Number | Shows if the mower is ready to mow (1=ready, 0=not ready, readonly)|
|mowed | Dimmer | Cut grass in percent (readonly)|

For example you can use this sitemap entry to control the mower manually:

```
Switch item=indegostate  mappings=[ 1="Mow", 2="Return",3="Pause" ]
```

## Meaning of the numeric statecodes

You can use this as .map file
