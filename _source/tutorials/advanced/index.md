# Overview

The goal of this part is to present a second level of use of openHAB 2 with a more complex binding: the z-wave binding.

This binding manages z-wave devices network. This network is a set of hardware devices that provides functionalities such as appliances, window shades, thermostats, and home lighting. This will allow us to learn how automatic discovery of things work.

This binding can be used with a different UI than the Paper UI, called HABmin 2.

The goal of HABmin 2 is to provide a modern, professional and portable user interface for openHAB, providing user functions, administrative functions and configuration utilities to aid setup. 

HABmin is intended as a complete GUI for the openHAB Home Automation system but it is also built with Z-Wave specific functionalities. It is the reason why we will introduce HABmin there.
