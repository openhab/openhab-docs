# Samsung TV Binding

This binding integrates the [Samsung TV's](http://www.samsung.com).

## Supported Things

Samsung TV C (2010), D (2011) and E (2012) models should be supported. Because Samsung haven't publish any documentation about the TV's UPnP interface, there could be differences between different TV models, which could lead to mismatch problems.

Tested TV models:

| Model     | State | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UE46E5505 | OK | Initial contribution is done by this model |


## Discovery

The TV's are discovered through UPnP protocol in the local network and all devices are put in the Inbox.

## Binding Configuration

The binding does not require any special configuration

## Thing Configuration

The Samsung TV Thing requires the host name and port address as a configuration value in order for the binding to know how to access it. Samsung TV publish several UPnP devices and hostname is used to recognize those UPnP devices. Port address is used for remote control emulation protocol. Additionally, a refresh interval can be configured in milliseconds to specify how often TV resources are polled.

E.g.
```
Thing samsungtv:tv:livingroom [ hostname="192.168.1.10", port=55000, refreshInterval=1000]
```
